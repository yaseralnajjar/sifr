# Ad Hoc Phase: Emitted Rust Excellence

Status: active

## Original12K replacement terminal: approved, blocked, not merged (2026-09-07)

This is the authoritative current receipt. It supersedes pending authorization,
unused-review/gate allowances, and stale B7/B8/B9 status tables below without
erasing their historical evidence. The user's explicit replacement authorization
was consumed exactly once. **Both cumulative reviews and both integration gates
are now consumed; no third review or gate.** No later item was implemented.

Exact reviewed/gated candidate `822987be25dd99a1e98d0bf380c3355504a96f61`, assessed
and fetched main `fc9dbf04727577e93dec397b3570d7cfe4af33d0`, corpus
`8bcbe7ab7939e5c8362c10f61a80e368022cc372`. The owned fresh independent clone is
`/private/tmp/sifr-item12k-replacement.1xatjh/sifr`, branch
`codex/item12k-replacement-delivery`; existing remote PR branch remains
`codex/item12k-final-integration`. Normal ancestry from retained full integration
record `057dd2e2caf1f84306b370cee2c3be39918cbec3` and merged B7/B8/B9 is preserved;
excluded retained Item12 commit `8ad089a9458f35fcfa228e93fe44f4d69731828b` is not
an ancestor. All 16 independent submodules retain their exact approved gitlinks.
Only the actual phase-record integration conflict was resolved; no production
repair, compiler/lockfile/fixture/runner rewrite, or new mechanism was introduced.
The candidate has 202 changed paths against main, 32089 complete tracked entries,
and eight changed paths against the original approved candidate. Its five
non-record delta paths are byte-identical to independently approved main inputs.

The six registered prechecks passed: stdlib-manifest schema, file-size (3781
files, limit900), exact-base diff, TypeScript-Go guard, compatibility guard and
formatter-reference guard. The diff command used frozen base SHA `fc9dbf047...`
instead of its verified equivalent `origin/main`; no scope difference.
The sole remaining [remediation review](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3717#issuecomment-5562251011)
is **SATISFIED, no blockers**, scoped to the original approval plus exact changed
dependency inputs. Completed response SHA256
`138fcf9b801a774722bff3dd900d4a62e939a65c6e004196079b8df115092fe5`.
Readiness evidence from the old candidate remains historical because B8 added a
scanned Python test file; the replacement gate actually passed current readiness4.
No inherited evidence is relabeled as fresh execution on this SHA.

### Replacement gate result and qualification boundary

`scripts/run_all_tests.sh --profile merge` completed **FAILED**, exit1 after
4376.64s (profile measured4373.85s). All13 guardrails passed, including file-size,
full demo freshness and manifest schema. Actual current area results:
Rust10, readiness4, core5, CPython2, complete Python30 including all five named
dependency suites, diagnostics184, runtime30 with three explicit policy skips,
algorithmic12, and developer-tooling42 all have zero failures. B7/B8/B9's three
former blockers now actually pass in this gate. Generated-quality completed all
nine variants: panic-scan, intrinsic-panic-lint, rustfmt, determinism and freshness
passed; inventory, corpus, positive Clippy and demos failed. The four failures
belong to two later owners, recorded only and not started:

- **12K-B10 / [#3731](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3731)**:
  `ERQ-032.semantic_anchor` is absent from current `methods/list.rs`. Audit
  inventory and implementation blobs match assessed main. This repeats the
  existing “Naming cleanup validation findings (2026-09-05)” anchor finding,
  not a newly established list-codegen mechanism defect. Later owner must
  reconcile the semantic anchor without suppressing meaningful enforcement.
- **12K-B11 / [#3732](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3732)**: generated
  corpus, positive Clippy and demo Cargo commands cannot materialize exact-rev
  `sifr_runtime` at `822987be...` under enforced offline mode. Workspace locked
  fetch passed; the generated self-Git graph is not in that root lockfile.
  Preparation coverage is a bounded inference for later diagnosis, not proof
  of emitted Rust or lint failure. Preserve portable exact Git dependencies,
  offline policy and full coverage; no cache/path workaround was applied.

Full E2E, migrated stdlib, normally ignored driver builds
(`cargo test -p sifr_driver --lib -- --ignored --test-threads=1`), and all later
profile stages were **UNREACHED**, not passes or partial certification. The
cold-cache wall-time advisory is not host-sensitive performance evidence.
Original attempt1 remains FAILED3736.19s; attempt2 remains FAILED4376.64s.
Cumulative counts: **1 initial review, 1 remediation, 2 provider requests,
0 retries, 0 create-pr gates, 2 failed merge gates, 0 passing gates,
0 Sifr integration merges, 0 corpus merges**. Gate session11171 and qualifier88485,
profile89101 and generated-quality descendants have terminated; no live review
or gate handles remain. No source repairs or third attempt occurred.

[Sifr PR3717](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3717) and exact
[corpus PR48](https://github.com/sifr-lang/leetcode/pull/48) remain draft/unmerged.
No integration-dependent PR/owner is closed as delivered; a prior stacked-base
merge does not imply main delivery. B7/PR3725, B8/PR3727 and B9/PR3729 were already
normally merged to main; owners3722/3723/3724 are closed and their carried closure
receipts below remain authoritative over stale historical tables. Historical
12J/R1 NOT SATISFIED remains distinct from correcting M1 approval; M1-F3 is not
closed. Optional3726/3728/3730 and next items12D/E/F, Item12 and12A are untouched.
Parent's two dirty Markdown files, branch/index/tree and all predecessor caches
were preserved read-only. Post-gate changes are phase/owner Markdown records
only; their record SHA and terminal ledger are published on PR3717. This worker
stops with blockers3731/3732, without claiming item closure or requesting a
silent allowance reset.

## Original12K replacement continuation ownership (2026-09-06)

Sole current implementer owns `/private/tmp/sifr-item12k-replacement.1xatjh/sifr`,
branch `codex/item12k-replacement-delivery`, its independent Git database/index,
and sibling `tmp`, `uv-cache`, `pycache`, and `evidence` directories. Starting
record is `057dd2e2caf1f84306b370cee2c3be39918cbec3`. Parent and predecessor
checkouts remain read-only. Canonical JSON outputs are in owned
`target/verification/areas/item12k-replacement-*`. `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` is unset;
`TMPDIR`, `UV_CACHE_DIR`, and `PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX` use those owned sibling
directories, with `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=6` and `RUST_TEST_THREADS=1`.

The following current parent authorization and dependency receipts are carried
verbatim before integration. They supersede historical pending authorization
and zero-count statements below. One initial review and one failed integration
gate are already consumed; at most one remediation review and exactly one
authorized replacement gate remain. No third gate or next item is authorized.

## Current orchestration: 12K blocked; bounded tooling owners (2026-09-06)

This section supersedes older pending original12K review/gate statements, not
their historical evidence. Arendt is closed after its [terminal receipt](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3717#issuecomment-5561937700).
Original12K is **approved, externally blocked, not merged**. Exact reviewed and
gated candidate `56907f59cc7d9f9fedb89434970c074c0247dee9`, record
`057dd2e2caf1f84306b370cee2c3be39918cbec3`, assessed main

corpus #48 remains unmerged. Preserved checkout:
`/private/tmp/sifr-item12k-delivery.4J6JeK/sifr`, local branch
`codex/item12k-final-delivery`; remote PR branch `codex/item12k-final-integration`.

Its [integration review](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3717#issuecomment-5561494295)
is SATISFIED/no blockers across 202 changed paths. Counts consumed: one initial
review, zero remediation, one provider request, zero retries, zero create-pr
gates, **one failed merge gate**, zero Sifr/corpus merges. All handles completed.
The 3736.19s gate passed all 13 guardrails and Rust10/readiness4/core5/CPython2/
Python30 (all five suites)/diagnostics184/runtime30 (three explicit policy skips)/
algorithmic12. Developer tooling failed three of 42 variants. Full E2E, migrated
stdlib and normally ignored driver builds remain unreached, not certified.
Actual main-ref materialization and manifest checks resolved #3721; its historical
B5 gate stays failed. No allowance resets and no second original12K gate.

predecessor checkouts/targets; terminal own target23GiB/free67GiB.

### Sequential later items and named validation

Execution order: **12K-B7, 12K-B8, 12K-B9**, then adjudicate original12K delivery
using their qualified receipts and the consumed-gate rule. No later emitted-code
item becomes ready merely because these narrow checks pass. After valid 12K
delivery, retain 12D,12E,12F,retained Item12,docs-only12A order. Parent only
orchestrates; each new worker owns one fresh checkout/branch/index/temp root.

- **12K-B7 / [#3722](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3722)**: merged;
  depends on the terminal12K diagnosis, not on unmerged integration delivery.
  Restore the TypeScript-Go direct filesystem inventory for all 22 pre-existing
  sites in six missing paths. Explicitly adjudicate inline-test inventory
  boundaries; preserve meaningful source-provider ownership and enforcement.
  Do not change compiler behavior or broadly suppress observations. Named tests:
  `python3 verification/areas/developer_tooling/check_typescript_go_transfer_guardrails.py`
  and the same command with `--self-test`; `git diff --check`;
  `python3 scripts/check_file_size_guardrails.py`. Register any necessary focused
  new regression command before execution. Expected scope is inventory Markdown
  and, only if necessary, its owning checker/tests. Use current main for a narrow
  independently deliverable PR; retain the integration checkout as read-only
  provenance. One exact-SHA review plus at most one remediation. No Sifr gates
  absent compiler/lockfile/fixture/workflow changes. Merge/update owner and stop.
- **12K-B8 / [#3723](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3723)**: merged;
  execution dependency B7 terminal/merged. Distinguish three legitimate SQL
  dialect `bigint` spellings from removed Sifr scalar support. Preserve SQL names
  and real compatibility rejection; no broad suppression. Named tests:
  `python3 verification/areas/developer_tooling/check_no_pre_v1_compatibility.py`
  and its `--self-test`, plus focused SQL-spelling versus removed-language-type
  regressions registered before execution, diff and file-size checks. Narrow
  guard owner; no unrelated SQL/compiler behavior changes.
- **12K-B9 / [#3724](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3724)**: merged;
  execution dependency B8 terminal/merged. Reconcile formatter preview reference
  with actual supported behavior and existing capability/CLI manifests, including
  all eight failed checks. Do not infer or introduce a formatter mechanism fix.
  Named tests: `python3 verification/areas/developer_tooling/check_formatter_rules_manifests.py`
  and its `--self-test`, diff and file-size checks. Expected documentation-only.

### Original12K delivery authorization checkpoint

All three developer-tooling owners B7/B8/B9 are now merged independently to main.
Original12K itself remains approved but unmerged, with one failed gate consumed;
no worker may infer another allowance from the dependency merges. Parent asked:
"Once B9 merges, do you authorize one replacement 12K integration gate on the
corrected candidate, preserving the failed attempt and reusing valid evidence?"
The user explicitly answered **"Aithorize"** to the request for one replacement
integration gate. This resolves the authorization blocker on 2026-09-06 and
supersedes earlier no-replacement instructions for this single attempt only.
The goal is active again with its unchanged full objective. Do not fabricate
a new item or erase the consumed failed gate. Retained original12K
source/corpus/evidence remain in the delivery clone above; actual remote main
was rechecked as `fc9dbf04727577e93dec397b3570d7cfe4af33d0`.

### Authorized original12K replacement qualification and delivery

Dispatch one fresh no-history gpt-6-astra high worker for original **12K**.
All previous workers are closed. Scope remains the original integration and
normal delivery, not a new compiler mechanism or whole-phase closure. Read the
complete retained original12K scope, dependencies, acceptance and command
registrations in `/private/tmp/sifr-item12k-delivery.4J6JeK/sifr/plans/issues/active/ad-hoc-emitted-rust-excellence.md`
and its top terminal receipt; this current authorization supersedes stale
zero-count and no-replacement statements there.

Start an owned clone/branch/index/temp root from full integration record
`057dd2e2caf1f84306b370cee2c3be39918cbec3`, incorporate current main containing
the approved B7/B8/B9 normal merges, and carry their post-merge closure records
including B9 `4a4ba794de222569a108febf795224c19cd37309`. Preserve all normal
12B/H/I/correctingM1/B1/B2/B3/B4/B5/B6 ancestry and exact corpus gitlink
`8bcbe7ab7939e5c8362c10f61a80e368022cc372`; retain all 16 exact submodules.
Do not rebuild the stack from main alone or incorporate retained Item12
`8ad089a9458f35fcfa228e93fe44f4d69731828b`. Parent/predecessor checkouts, indexes,
targets and dirty records remain read-only. Existing qualified code should not
be rewritten merely because this worker is fresh. Resolve only actual in-scope
integration conflicts; no unrelated follow-up repairs.

Before qualification, materialize actual `refs/remotes/origin/main` with a fetch
refspec and verify its retained manifest. Keep `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` unset: owned
default outer target and nested probes' separate caches under owned TMPDIR;
own UV/Python caches, CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=6 and RUST_TEST_THREADS=1 as registered.
Canonical JSON reports belong inside the owned repository. Inspect free disk
and own target before long Cargo; no cleanup of predecessor targets.

Authenticate complete relevant-input maps and prior SHA-keyed receipts before
reusing validation or review. Original12K already consumed **one initial
SATISFIED review, zero remediation reviews, one provider request, zero retries,
one FAILED merge-profile gate**, with no integration/corpus merge. Preserve
those counts. Assess the dependency delta against that exact approval; if a
review is required for changed relevant inputs, use at most the single
remaining remediation review on the final exact SHA, not another initial
review or a third round. Give the reviewer original approval and qualified
B7/B8/B9 receipts; keep unchanged approval/evidence attributable to their real
SHAs. New second-review mechanism defects become later items, not another round.

Named checks remain the original12K registration. Reuse unchanged native90,
full algorithmic411, diagnostics184, readiness4, Python30/allfive, demos264,
codegen1452, lowering1119/1ignored, frontend139, IR4, types147, required-message/
async filters, focused18+8, driver595/77normallyignored/doctests and strictClippy
only after authenticating relevant inputs. Reuse B7/B8/B9 focused evidence for
unchanged inputs, not as a replacement for the broad gate. Before the gate,
run registered `python3 scripts/check_stdlib_manifest_schema.py`,
`python3 scripts/check_file_size_guardrails.py`, `git diff --check origin/main HEAD`,
and any actually affected named focused validation; register any necessary
new focused command before execution. Complete in-scope corrections before
testing. Historical failed/unreached executions never become passes by inference.

Then run **one newly authorized replacement**
`scripts/run_all_tests.sh --profile merge` on the final approved exact SHA;
skip create-pr for in-session merge. This is cumulative integration gate
attempt two, with attempt one permanently FAILED. No third gate authorized.
Full E2E, migrated stdlib and normally ignored driver build lanes still require
actual pass, including the registered ignored driver command
`cargo test -p sifr_driver --lib -- --ignored --test-threads=1` in the gate.
No partial certification, disabled guard, narrower fixture manifest or positive
prefix may replace complete qualification. No repeat broad standalone matrices
merely to warm a cache; cold builds are not host-sensitive performance evidence.

On complete pass, normal corpus PR48 and Sifr integration PR3717 delivery and
related PR/owner/phase reconciliation are authorized. Freeze source/corpus/
gitlinks before review and gate so delivery preserves approved inputs and
normal ancestry. Record actual merge SHAs; preserve failed12J/R1 history versus
separately approved correctingM1. Follow-up records need no repeat gate/review.
On a true external blocker or new second-review mechanism, record its later
owner and stop. Do not absorb optional3726/3728/3730 or later12D/E/F/Item12/12A.
Return terminal item, PRs, exact SHAs, evidence/counts, changed paths, owned
checkout, blocker or none, and completed/live handle disposition; then stop.

Sole live implementer: Hooke (`01a0788c-f8c0-7763-ab1e-270c3f0c040e`).
The authorized replacement gate is unrun at this registration.

### Replacement candidate validation registration

Main integrated normally with only a phase-record conflict; all five non-record
B7/B8/B9 paths retain their approved main blobs. Compiler, corpus, lockfile,
fixture, workflow and runner inputs match the original reviewed integration.
Carry B9 closure from `4a4ba794de222569a108febf795224c19cd37309` below.
Complete-tree and receipt authentication is recorded in owned
`target/verification/areas/item12k-replacement-provenance.json`.

Run these existing named commands after freezing the candidate:

```bash
python3 scripts/check_stdlib_manifest_schema.py
python3 scripts/check_file_size_guardrails.py
git diff --check origin/main HEAD
python3 verification/areas/developer_tooling/check_typescript_go_transfer_guardrails.py
python3 verification/areas/developer_tooling/check_no_pre_v1_compatibility.py
python3 verification/areas/developer_tooling/check_formatter_rules_manifests.py
```

The three tooling scans cover the combined integration inputs. Reuse unchanged
B7/B8/B9 self-tests and B8's 14 focused regressions after input authentication.
Reuse original semantic matrices under the same complete-input rule; do not
label them fresh candidate runs. Changed compatibility-checker inputs require
the one remaining exact-SHA remediation review. Original approval and bounded
dependency approvals remain attributable to their actual SHAs. No initial
review reset. On SATISFIED, run the single authorized replacement command
`scripts/run_all_tests.sh --profile merge`; this is cumulative gate attempt two.
The unchanged merge profile includes all full E2E fixtures, migrated stdlib
lanes, and `cargo test -p sifr_driver --lib -- --ignored --test-threads=1`.
Their full outcomes must pass before delivery. No third gate or next item.

## Original 12K terminal receipt: approved, externally blocked (2026-09-06)

This is the current original 12K handoff. Earlier checkpoint statements below
remain historical evidence. State: **integration reviewed and approved; sole
merge gate failed on three pre-existing developer-tooling owners; not merged,
not closed**. No next-item implementation or whole-phase review occurred.

- PR: [#3717](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3717), still draft.
- Exact reviewed/gated candidate: `56907f59cc7d9f9fedb89434970c074c0247dee9`.
- Exact assessed main: `f11e1cd7eef16a02063555bccc9fd8e19287833b`.
- Exact corpus: `8bcbe7ab7939e5c8362c10f61a80e368022cc372`,
  [leetcode #48](https://github.com/sifr-lang/leetcode/pull/48), unmerged.
- Starting complete record: `e9cce681e039f918aaf64daebe0d415195bb6f96`.
- Owned checkout: `/private/tmp/sifr-item12k-delivery.4J6JeK/sifr`;
  local branch `codex/item12k-final-delivery`, PR branch
  `codex/item12k-final-integration`. Parent dirty Markdown, all predecessor
  checkouts, indexes, targets and retained evidence remained read-only.
- All 202 integration changed paths, 32,088 tracked tree entries and 16 exact
  clean submodule checkouts authenticated. The provenance JSON enumerates all
  paths and retained ancestry. This continuation changed only this phase
  Markdown before review; no integration source correction was necessary.
- Normal 12B/H/I/correcting M1/B1/B2/B3/B4/B5/B6 ancestry is preserved.
  Separate Item12 source `8ad089a` remains excluded. Historical 12J/R1 reviews
  remain NOT SATISFIED; only the correcting M1 lineage is approved.
- Final record SHA is published in the external terminal receipt following this
  documentation-only commit. Sifr/corpus merge SHAs: **none**.

### Completed review and exact-candidate evidence

The original single Opus integration review completed **SATISFIED**, no blockers,
on all 202 paths against assessed main. [Published review](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3717#issuecomment-5561494295).
The interrupted turn's original process was resumed and consumed, not restarted.
Response SHA256: `ef02a6509f907dd87e6cf0a6869ed0f024f11688b8b4f8a20f62758b79850fa3`.

The newly named retained-manifest check, file-size guard (3780 files / 900 lines)
and exact-base diff check passed. Setup fetched actual main into local
`refs/remotes/origin/main` and verified its retained manifest; no baseline
override. This resolves the local setup omission #3721 without changing a guard.
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR` remained unset, with the owned default outer target and
nested probes' separate caches under owned TMPDIR. New Python/UV caches and
all canonical JSON reports were inside the owned paths. No prior target was reused.

The sole `scripts/run_all_tests.sh --profile merge` on the approved candidate
completed **FAILED exit 1 after 3736.19 seconds**. No retry or second gate.
It passed Cargo setup and all 13 guardrails, including fresh demo companions
and the formerly blocked retained-manifest stage. Actual area outcomes:

| Area | Actual result in this gate |
| --- | --- |
| Rust interop | PASS, 10 variants |
| Coverage readiness | PASS, 4 variants |
| Core language | PASS, 5 variants |
| CPython differential | PASS, 2 variants |
| Complete Python interop | PASS, 30 variants, all five named dependency suites included |
| Diagnostics | PASS, 184 variants |
| Runtime platform | PASS under its policy, 30 variants, 3 explicit skips |
| Algorithmic representative subset | PASS, 12 variants |
| Developer tooling | FAIL, 42 variants, 3 blocking failures |

Runtime-platform skips were the existing capability-gated HTTP body fixture and
two sanitizer smokes requiring unavailable llvm-symbolizer. These are explicit
profile-policy skips, not newly certified runtime coverage.
All subsequent areas and toolchain stages were **unreached**, including full
E2E, migrated stdlib and normally ignored driver generated builds. Passing
prefixes do not certify them. The cold build and exceeded advisory wall budget
are not host-sensitive performance evidence.

Before review and again at handoff, complete relevant-input authentication
preserved 78 historical receipts plus 25 B5 artifacts (104 distinct authenticated
artifacts including anchors). Retained executions remain correctly attributed:
native90, full algorithmic411, Python30/all five suites, diagnostics184,
readiness4, demos264, codegen1452, lowering1119/1 existing ignored, frontend139,
IR4, types147, required-message/async filters, B2/B3 focused18, B4 focused8,
B5 driver595/77 normally ignored/successful doctests and strict Clippy.
They are inherited evidence, not freshly rerun standalone matrices on this SHA.
The new gate's actual area executions are recorded separately above.

### External failure owners; no repairs here

1. **12K-B7 / [#3722](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3722)**,
   compiler/tooling filesystem inventory: 22 direct read/probe sites in six
   paths are absent from the transfer inventory. Every exact source line
   already exists on main; checker and inventory blobs are unchanged.
   Inline tests in materialize.rs are among the scanner's current observations.
2. **12K-B8 / [#3723](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3723)**,
   compiler/tooling compatibility with SQL owners: three PostgreSQL/MySQL
   database `bigint` spellings trigger the removed-Sifr-type token rule.
   Source, checker and retained-contract registry are identical to main.
3. **12K-B9 / [#3724](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3724)**,
   formatter reference/manifests: eight missing/drifted checks for
   `--preview`, `--no-preview`, preview capability requirements and
   `fmt_cli_preview_flags`. Reference, all manifests, checker and Ruff
   gitlink are unchanged from main. Formatter behavior/AST checks passed.

These are read-only provenance diagnoses, not rerun test commands or
integration fixes. Owning issues contain exact locations, unchanged blobs,
originating commits and focused validation recommendations. No later-item code,
guard weakening or new language behavior was implemented.

Nonblocking review suggestions remain separate: pre-canonicalization raw tuple
grouping is erased before artifacts are written (later emitted-quality owner);
compiler-internal conversion assertions depend on the required-message lowering
invariant (existing M1-F1 hardening owner). The review's pending-gate observation
is now the explicit failed qualification above, not an additional code defect.

Counts: **1 initial integration review, 0 remediation reviews, 1 provider request,
0 retries, 0 create-pr gates, 1 failed merge-profile gate, 0 passing gates,
0 Sifr merges, 0 corpus merges**. Three fresh standalone named checks passed;
other fresh validation occurred only within this one gate. No count is reset.

Review handle44502 and gate handle89382 both completed and were consumed.
No live command/review/gate remains at handoff. Pre-gate free disk96GiB / target
3.7MiB; terminal free disk67GiB / target23GiB. No cleanup occurred; retained
target evidence stays intact, and no further long Cargo command is planned.

Dependent PRs #3694/#3697/#3698/#3700/#3701/#3702/#3713/#3715/#3717/#3719 and
corpus#48 remain preserved, without a qualified main delivery or superseding
closure. GitHub reports #3720 merged into its stacked B5 base; this is not a
main integration merge. B5's old failed gate remains failed and consumed.

Exact next action belongs to the orchestrator: assign the three recorded
external owners sequentially, preserve this exact integration approval and
failed gate, and determine the remaining delivery authorization after their
qualified handoffs. This receipt authorizes no second original12K gate and
claims no completed delivery. The worker stops here, without 12D/E/F, retained
Item12, 12A or whole-phase work.

## Item12K-B5 terminal checkpoint: external driver doctest blocker (2026-09-06)

State: **implemented, unreviewed, not merged; external-validation-blocked**.
[Draft stacked PR #3719](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3719) preserves
the narrow B5 implementation for [owner #3716](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3716).
This is the current B5 receipt; all original12K/predecessor records below remain
historical evidence with unchanged consumed budgets. The inherited integration
stack in PR3717 remains unreviewed; B5 has not approved or delivered it.

- Exact retained integration/review base:
  `9f8dbec61c4416d5d002a1a9c90913c00a06fe9a`.
- Main: `f11e1cd7eef16a02063555bccc9fd8e19287833b`, fetched and retained as
  an ancestor; no rebase or history rewrite was needed.
- Owned registration: `6b07cf476` copied the new parent B5 dispatch before code.
- Implementation candidate: `d4d7eb5cc80e6e4e623e3b5d343702e5055f8946`.
  Reviewed/approved SHA: **none**. Merge SHA: **none**.
- Exact corpus: `8bcbe7ab7939e5c8362c10f61a80e368022cc372`, unmerged PR48;
  all normal integration ancestry and all16 exact clean submodules retained.
- Owned clone `/private/tmp/sifr-item12k-b5.5WJpGX/sifr`, branch
  `codex/item12k-b5-portable-clippy`. Parent and predecessor checkouts,
  targets, indexes and dirty records remained read-only. No test remains live.

The complete code batch changed only
`crates/sifr_driver/src/build/cargo_manifest.rs` (equivalent explicit package
alias `if/else`) and `crates/sifr_driver/src/build/portable_project.rs` (private
transparent `AuthorityPackageChecksums` alias for the identical BTreeMap type).
Generated manifest bytes, authoritative lock parsing/source/checksum selection,
errors and ordering are unchanged. No lint allowance, fallback, fixture,
lockfile, workflow, metadata-assertion duplication or unrelated repair was added.
The only other changed path is this phase Markdown. No architecture/roadmap
status changed and no next-item code was started.

Registered validation ran after the complete code batch. Format, HIR
maintainability, file-size (3780 files/900-line limit) and diff checks passed.
The one fresh `cargo test -p sifr_driver` ran 16:00:03–16:13:24 UTC and exited
**1**: **595 unit tests passed,0 failed,77 normally ignored**, then
`Doc-tests sifr_driver` aborted with twelve `E0463` crate-resolution errors.
This complete invocation is **FAILED**. The old original12K594/1/77ignored
invocation also remains failed. Strict workspace Clippy was queued after the
driver command and was **not reached**. Full E2E, migrated stdlib and normally
ignored driver generated-build lanes remain **unrun**, not inferred passes.

External owner/receipt: [#3718](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3718),
compiler validation / driver Cargo-rustdoc integration. Read-only checks found
the sampled frontend/lowering/Ruff AST `.rlib` files present at rustdoc's exact
paths and matching Rust/rustdoc1.98.0(88d9e12ae). The root cause remains
unestablished; no portable-project regression is asserted. Own target5.1GiB,
116GiB free, no cleanup or cache reset. No focused/doctest retry, unrelated
implementation or gate was used to work around the failure.

exact two source transformations. Retained native90, algorithmic411,
diagnostics184, readiness4, codegen1452, lowering1119, Python30/all five suites,
demo264 and focused18+8 remain historical authenticated evidence. They are not
fresh B5 executions, broad integration approval, a replacement for pending
lanes, or a performance claim for this cold owned target.

Actual B5 counts: **0initial reviews,0remediation reviews,0provider requests,
0provider retries,0create-pr gates,0merge-profile gates,0merges**. The prepared
Opus prompt and atomic wrapper were never executed. Original12K counts remain
zero and all predecessor consumed budgets remain unchanged. This is an external
validation stop, not an approved `integration-delivery-pending` handoff.

Exact next action: separately scope diagnosis/resolution or adjudication of
#3718, then resume this preserved B5 candidate with an actual passing full-driver
invocation and strict Clippy. Its narrow exact-SHA review (max one remediation)
and sole governed merge-profile gate remain unused. A fresh original12K owner
still owns broad integration review and safe delivery of the inherited stack.
No full-phase review or12D/E/F/retainedItem12/12A work is authorized by this record.

## Original12K terminal checkpoint: external portable-project Clippy blocker (2026-09-06)

Current state: **preserved, unreviewed integration; blocked before review/gate**.
[Draft PR #3717](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3717) preserves candidate
`286067170ee7c4edfb61cd37afece30519b4c1c5`, based on latest fetched main
`f11e1cd7eef16a02063555bccc9fd8e19287833b`, full approved B4 record
`b73e5e5991eb11e2911fc413e7956e4f9d4d2eae`, and own registration
`6d205298e18761077a945a0301c0025c9810b174`. This checkpoint supersedes earlier
current-state/remaining-work statements, without rewriting historical receipts.
Owned clone `/private/tmp/sifr-item12k-final.7sgsI9/sifr`, branch
`codex/item12k-final-integration`, private database/index/target/temp/evidence;
parent and all predecessor clones/targets remain read-only. No live check remains.

The bounded integration correction changes only the existing metadata-helper
test to inspect parsed Rust syntax rather than redundant-parenthesis-sensitive
text. Both affected paths since B4 are
`crates/sifr_driver/src/stdlib/stateless_python_codegen_tests.rs` and this phase
record. The full inherited integration changes200paths against main; all approved
12B/H/I/correctingM1/B1/B2/B3/B4 and original12K ancestry remains intact. Unfinished
Item12 source8ad089a remains excluded. Corpus

remains exact and unmerged; no delivery or gitlink change occurred.

Fresh qualification completed: locked compiler build; corrected metadata test1;
frontend139,IR4,type-system147; required-message driver5; async error-channel9;
native90/90 with all checks/native assertions; canonical algorithmic411/411;

19profilerows,27negatives/fulltaxonomy). Formatting passed before candidate
commit; file-size3780/900 and diff checks passed at the terminal boundary.
The earlier full-driver invocation remains **FAILED594pass/1fail/77ignored**;
its sole assertion was corrected and passed freshly, not relabeled as a whole
passing invocation. The focused diagnosis also failed before correction and is
retained honestly. HIR and the queued final format repeat were unreached after
Clippy. Full E2E/migrated stdlib/ignored generated-build gate lanes remain unrun.

Authenticated retained evidence: codegen1452,lowering1119/required-message3,
Python30 including all five named suites,demo264,B2/B3focused18,B4focused8.
Complete32088 candidate paths, prior32087/32088 maps, all16 exact clean submodules
and29 evidence receipts were compared. The changed test invalidated readiness,
so its complete4checks were rerun successfully. Reuse is not a fresh execution,
performance claim, or conversion of any historical failed gate into a pass.

### Carried parent dispatch

### Approved B4 handoff and original12K continuation (2026-09-06)

Ampere is closed. [PR #3715](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3715)
preserves approved B4 candidate `5c711f2d6cb90265b32e04e8b9f6b6e3570855c1`
and documentation record `b73e5e5991eb11e2911fc413e7956e4f9d4d2eae`, based
on12K record `5de50ecafc84ed1fa724e7384ad85689a6925dfb`, in
`/private/tmp/sifr-item12k-b4-qualified.X1Lz43/sifr`.
[Receipt](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3712#issuecomment-5559892381)
and [review](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3715#issuecomment-5559872361)
establish one SATISFIED initial review, zero remediation/retries/gates/merges.
Readiness4/4 passes (13 guarantees,34 surfaces,zero temporary rows,19 profile
rows,27 negative cases,full taxonomy); eight focused tests/direct taxonomy and
static checks pass under the formerly failing caller ancestor. BothB4 and12K
histories remain ancestral; no compiler/SQL implementation was redone.
Two nonblocking B4-F1/F2 clarity/coverage suggestions remain in its record.

The only B4 delivery dependency is the already authorized integration itself.
Do not create a new blocker or prerequisite merely because the approved stack
is unmerged. Dispatch a fresh original12K worker from this complete record,
assess latest main and preserve the original12B/H/I/correctingM1/B1/B2/B3/B4
and corpus histories. The prior12K scope, named commands, remaining work and
one initial integration review/at most one remediation/one final merge gate
remain unchanged and unused. B4's narrow review is not integration approval.

Reuse authenticated B4 readiness/focused and prior12K codegen1452, B1 lowering1119,
Python30 and demo264 evidence only after unchanged complete-input verification;
do not spend time rebuilding completed code or reflexively repeating those runs.
Continue pending driver/other crate/filter checks, native90, algorithmic411,
full diagnostics, strict Clippy, and all remaining registered qualification.
Copy/adapt owned native-script roots without altering case selection or assertions.
All canonical result-json outputs stay inside the fresh owned repository.
Finish any actual integration corrections before tests; register concrete new
focused commands before running them. The actual full E2E/migrated stdlib lanes
must pass in the one exact-approved-SHA merge-profile gate before integration
merge. Skip create-pr for in-session merge; no second gate or allowance reset.

Ordinary safe corpus and Sifr integration merges, dependent PR/issue disposition,
and phase-record updates are authorized after valid prerequisite qualification,
integration review and gate. Freeze exact source/corpus/gitlink provenance
before review so no unreviewed input enters afterward. Preserve historical
failed/unreviewed checkpoints honestly, including originalJ/R1's superseded
NOT SATISFIED reviews. Publish exact approved and merged SHAs and evidence.
A genuinely new external mechanism follows the existing later-owner stop rule;

### Owned commands and delivery plan

Focused diagnosis registered after the first complete driver invocation:
`cargo test -p sifr_driver python_zero_copy_helpers_codegen_through_sifr_stdlib -- --nocapture`.
The full run has594passes,1failure,77existingignored. Its only failure expects
`py_buffer_shape(&raw.0)?` at stateless_python_codegen_tests.rs:262. Extend the
assertion diagnostic to include actual public emission before this focused run;
do not change its acceptance condition before establishing cause. All later
qualification commands remain unreached, and review/gate budgets remain unused.

Diagnosis completed: all six helpers emit `accessor(&(raw).0)?`; borrowing and
typed propagation are unchanged. The integration omission is the exact-text
assertion's sensitivity to redundant expression parentheses, not a runtime
mechanism defect. Correct the existing test using parsed Rust syntax: require
each of the same six named calls to have exactly one immutable borrow of raw's
tuple field0 directly under `?`, ignoring only grouping/parentheses. The private
interop-call assertions remain intact. No compiler/stdlib behavior changes.
Run the registered focused test after this complete correction; reuse the594
other full-driver passes only for unchanged implementation and test inputs,
with the failed full invocation preserved. Then resume pending commands from
frontend onwards. Existing whole-driver evidence is not called a passing run.

The original and continuation execution registrations remain authoritative.
All registered commands use this owned repository and these environment paths:
`TMPDIR=/private/tmp/sifr-item12k-final.7sgsI9/tmp`,
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/private/tmp/sifr-item12k-final.7sgsI9/sifr/target`,

`PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX=/private/tmp/sifr-item12k-final.7sgsI9/pycache`,
`CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=6`, `RUST_TEST_THREADS=1`.
Every canonical area output is `target/verification/areas/item12k-*.json`
inside this repository. The external native script is
`/private/tmp/sifr-item12k-final.7sgsI9/native_qualification.py`; output is
`/private/tmp/sifr-item12k-final.7sgsI9/native-qualified`, with roots-only

codegen1452, B1 lowering1119 including required-message3, Python30 including all
five named suites, demo264, B2/B3 focused18 and B4 readiness4/focused8 evidence.
The build command supplies a fresh owned binary for pending native commands;
retained build evidence is not permission to write old targets. Any invalidated
named check uses the earlier exact command with owned paths. No extra suites,
partial certification bypass, altered corpus selection, or inferred gate pass.

Freeze corpus gitlink `8bcbe7ab7939e5c8362c10f61a80e368022cc372`.
After qualification/review/gate, normal merge of corpus PR48 preserves that
qualified source as an ancestor; never repin to its later merge commit. Normal
integration merge must preserve the approved tree. Verify both expected PR
heads/bases first. Reconcile superseded/dependent PRs accurately with provenance,
and publish separate record-only closure commits without review/gate repetition.


Current B4 state: **qualified and Opus-approved stacked checkpoint; integration
merge pending**, [draft #3715](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3715).
See the terminal receipt and "B4 qualified-context continuation registration"
below. Earlier B4 dispatch and terminal entries are historical records; their
independent-main stop and ownership paths do not describe this worker.

## B4 reviewed stacked handoff (2026-09-06)

Item: **12K-B4**, owner compiler-verification, issue [#3712](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3712).
The bounded checker implementation is complete, qualified and approved.
This worker stops at the explicitly authorized reviewed handoff; it has not
merged B4 or the inherited compiler stack and does not claim integration closure.

- Stacked draft: [#3715](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3715), branch
  `codex/item12k-b4-qualified`, based on preserved #3713's branch.
- Exact integrated base: `5de50ecafc84ed1fa724e7384ad85689a6925dfb`.
- Candidate and reviewed implementation: `5c711f2d6cb90265b32e04e8b9f6b6e3570855c1`.
- Reviewed tree: `33768107c3ab765533a66b2a98bdfc43d9a30b13`.
- Record SHA: the separate documentation-only commit containing this receipt;
  its full SHA is published in the terminal receipt on #3712/#3715 after push.
- Merge SHA: **none**.
- Owned clone: `/private/tmp/sifr-item12k-b4-qualified.X1Lz43/sifr`.
  Parent's intentional two dirty Markdown files and every old worker checkout,
  branch/index/target remain untouched and read-only.

Both source lineages remain ancestral: 12K candidate
`fbe5ca93e61c5286268f2b42a768901a907544f4`, record/base `5de50ecafc84ed1fa724e7384ad85689a6925dfb`;
B4 source implementation `eaa4a063b69ee2132bef55514361062e85db3548`, record
`a3cf7620088a3fda9c0935fbf29f511ac862f1f3`. The normal merge follows prior
adjudication registration `90b992a05b16e14a56d97eea42783828d8b6757b`.
Only the SQL Markdown record conflicted; both histories were preserved.
GitHub main remains `f11e1cd7eef16a02063555bccc9fd8e19287833b` with no newer
changes. All inherited non-B4 paths are identical to integrated base; both
checker/test blobs are identical to preserved B4 implementation. Approved
12B/H/I/correctingM1/B1/B2/B3 ancestry remains; unfinished Item12 source
`8ad089a9458f35fcfa228e93fe44f4d69731828b` is excluded. Corpus
`8bcbe7ab7939e5c8362c10f61a80e368022cc372` and its PR48 remain unchanged/open.

Fresh named qualification on the exact candidate, using the previously
registered owned paths and intentionally matching `-item12k` TMPDIR ancestor:

| Named check | Actual result |
| --- | --- |
| Direct taxonomy | PASS: original self-tests and full repository audit |
| Focused path-boundary tests | 8/8 PASS, one invocation |
| Readiness strict registry | PASS: 13 guarantees, 34 surfaces, zero temporary rows |
| Readiness profile assignment | PASS: 19 rows |
| Readiness negative self-tests | PASS: actual integrated 27 cases |
| Readiness taxonomy | PASS: original self-tests and full repository audit |
| Complete readiness suite | 4/4 PASS, zero failures, one invocation |
| File-size guardrail | PASS: 3,780 files, limit900; checker761/test139 lines |
| Python syntax, record consistency, Git diff | PASS; clean before/after qualification |

The eight focused tests were rerun in the qualified context; none of the old
failed-main readiness result was reused. The historical main24 negatives and
23 SQL classification failures remain historical facts. The integrated
classification registry `6823a657db7d8660cafe86fcfd2b71b21a529cd3` and negative
self-test `7609e981d368b9e116e3e82dfb79c66d9422fc9f` are inherited unchanged,
not B4 SQL implementation. Retained codegen1452/B1 lowering1119/Python30/demo264
evidence remains with12K; no compiler/native/Python-interop/diagnostics test ran
here and no inherited result is represented as new B4 validation.

[Initial exact-SHA Opus review](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3715#issuecomment-5559872361):
**SATISFIED, no blocking findings**, covering only B4 and its checker interaction
with the integrated context. Claude independently checked exact SHAs/tree,
four-path delta, preserved policy/call sites, source blob identity and evidence
hashes without modifying files or rerunning validation. Raw atomic completed
response `/private/tmp/sifr-item12k-b4-qualified.X1Lz43/caller-tmp/sifr-claude.ESluOa/response.md`
has SHA256 `631e0c2fd6fff7f18f2843091dea8c9f4aec0629dbb77021ee2569ef397f19dd`.
The published `review-5c711f2d6cb90265b32e04e8b9f6b6e3570855c1.md` lives
outside the reviewed Git tree. This later record is not part of the approved
candidate and does not cause another review or test/gate cycle.

Deferred review observations, recorded as separate later work only:

| Later record | Owner | Observation and disposition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 12K-B4-F1 | compiler-verification | Reviewer labels the discarded `root.relative_to(audit_root)` result at checker339 an infrastructure/maintenance observation: a named boundary assertion helper could make the intentional raising call clearer. It is correct and covered now; no failure reproduced, no change required for B4. Not started. |
| 12K-B4-F2 | compiler-verification | Reviewer suggests an existing-file extension-filter case for the default repository root; current temporary-root cases already cover that branch. Optional test enhancement, not a missing B4 acceptance criterion. Not started. |
| Existing12K integration | original12K owner | Main lacks the already-reviewed SQL prerequisites. Preserve this approved checkpoint and finish original integration qualification/review/merge; do not create a duplicate SQL repair. |

Counts for B4: **1 initial review, 0 remediation reviews, 1 provider request,
0 failed requests/retries, 0 create-PR gates, 0 merge-profile gates, 0 merges**.
This continuation ran one direct taxonomy, one eight-test focused invocation,
one complete readiness invocation, one file-size and one syntax check. Earlier
B4 qualification attempts remain recorded separately. Original12K remains
**0 reviews,0 gates,0 merges**; all other historical caps remain unchanged.

B4 changed paths relative to integrated base are exactly:
`verification/areas/coverage_matrix/checks/verification_taxonomy.py`,
`verification/areas/coverage_matrix/checks/test_verification_taxonomy_paths.py`,
this phase record, and `ad-hoc-schema-first-sql-platform-review-follow-ups.md`.
Only the two Markdown records change in the post-review record commit.

**Explicit integration dependency:** an independent main merge cannot retain the
exact qualification inputs while main lacks the inherited prerequisite stack.
The user expressly chose a reviewed stacked checkpoint in that case. #3712
remains open for integration delivery; #3715 stays draft and unmerged.
No new external blocker or B4 mechanism defect exists. Exact next action belongs
to a fresh12K worker: preserve this candidate and record lineage alongside
#3713, reuse applicable B4 evidence, then complete original12K's remaining
qualification and its unused review/gate/merge allowances. This worker stops
now; no12K implementation,12D/E/F,Item12,12A or full-phase work is started.

## Item 12K-B4: owned authorization and test registration (2026-09-06)

Owner: compiler-verification; issue [#3712](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3712).
The parent supplied “Item12K continuation receipt and B4 dispatch (2026-09-06)”
and explicitly authorized this independent checker repair, Claude review, PR,
push, merge, and owner-record updates. All predecessors are closed. This sole
worker owns `/private/tmp/sifr-item12k-b4.3wWQdN/sifr`, its independent index and
target, and branch `codex/item12k-b4-path-boundary`, cloned from latest main
`f11e1cd7eef16a02063555bccc9fd8e19287833b`. The parent checkout's two dirty
Markdown records and every retained worker checkout/index/target remain read-only.
No unreviewed compiler stack is imported.

Scope: establish the fixture/audit root boundary in `verification_taxonomy.py`.
Caller ancestors must neither reject valid names nor suppress audited content.
Forbidden filenames and governed descendant directory names, content checks,
demo variable checks, and all existing negative self-tests remain enforced.
No caller-directory rename, TMPDIR evasion, basename-only check, allowlist,
ignored assertion, or taxonomy-policy relaxation is permitted. Unrelated
taxonomy and diagnostics findings remain with their existing owners.

Complete the bounded implementation and regressions before executing tests.
Registered commands, all from the owned clone:

```bash
TMPDIR=/private/tmp/sifr-item12k-b4.3wWQdN/tmp python3 verification/areas/coverage_matrix/checks/verification_taxonomy.py
TAXONOMY_TEST_TMPDIR=/private/tmp TMPDIR=/private/tmp/sifr-item12k-b4.3wWQdN/tmp python3 -m unittest discover -s verification/areas/coverage_matrix/checks -p test_verification_taxonomy_paths.py -v

git diff --check
```

The focused regressions create and remove only invocation-owned
`/private/tmp/sifr-taxonomy-*` trees (neutral absolute ancestors), then create
deliberately matching caller ancestors and skip-directory labels within them.
The original self-tests also run under both environments. The clone and TMPDIR
already have the formerly failing `-item12k` ancestor pattern. Evidence logs
live outside Git at `/private/tmp/sifr-item12k-b4.3wWQdN/`; readiness JSON stays
inside the owned repo as required. Documentation checks inspect this record's
scope, command registration, paths and final receipt; no compiler tests belong here.

One initial exact-SHA read-only Opus review and at most one remediation review;
at most three failed provider requests, atomic completed response only. No broad
repeat validation or invented requirements. A new second-review mechanism or
external blocker receives an owning later record and terminal handoff.
Checker/tests/docs-only changes receive zero Sifr create-PR or merge gates.
If compiler/lockfile/fixture/workflow inputs necessarily change, run one
merge-profile gate on the approved SHA, no create-PR gate and no retry.

Retained 12K draft #3713 candidate `fbe5ca93e61c5286268f2b42a768901a907544f4`
and record `5de50ecafc84ed1fa724e7384ad85689a6925dfb` remain unapproved:
zero reviews, gates, and merges. B4 resets no historical cap and does not
approve that stack. After B4 merge and phase/owner closure records, stop.
Do not resume 12K or start 12D/E/F, Item 12, 12A, or whole-phase review.

### B4 terminal receipt: SQL readiness dependency blocks independent main

State: implemented and preserved in [draft #3714](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3714),
not reviewed, not merged, not closed. Issue #3712 remains open.
Base: `f11e1cd7eef16a02063555bccc9fd8e19287833b`.
Implementation: `eaa4a063b69ee2132bef55514361062e85db3548`, preserving initial
commit `a8f7c86d864de13d97375d5e0daabc4f4621db29` and its test correction.
Reviewed implementation SHA: none. Merge SHA: none.
The final record commit is the docs-only commit containing this receipt;
its exact SHA is published on #3712 and #3714 after pushing.

The checker now carries an explicit owning audit root through filename checks,
skip filtering, collection, and demo-content routing. Production defaults to
the repository root; temporary self-tests explicitly own their fixture root.
No naming/text pattern, skip policy, allowance, or existing negative assertion
changed. Eight new tests exercise neutral, matching, and all eight skip-label
caller ancestors, valid paths, forbidden filenames and nested directories,
directory/file selections, content, demo variables, out-of-root rejection, and
the complete original self-tests.

Exact implementation evidence:

| Named check | Actual result |
| --- | --- |
| Direct taxonomy | PASS under the formerly failing `-item12k` ancestor |
| Focused path regressions | PASS: 8 tests |
| Readiness: coverage_matrix_readiness | FAIL: 23 existing SQL package/target classification diagnostics |
| Readiness: profile_assignment_matrix | PASS: 19 rows |
| Readiness: coverage_matrix_negative_self_tests | PASS: 24 cases on this main baseline |
| Readiness: verification_taxonomy | PASS: original self-tests plus full repository audit |
| File-size guardrail | PASS: 3,757 files, 900-line limit; checker 761 and tests 139 lines |
| Python syntax; documentation and Git diffs | PASS |

The readiness command completed once after a sandbox-network setup failure
was resolved through approved network access. The earlier setup failure ran
no area checks and is not qualification evidence. The first focused run found
an incorrect new test expectation for an existing filename-policy form;
the test was corrected to the already-rejected `work-item-helper` form without
changing policy. The complete final focused run passes. No test result from
the initial implementation is relabeled as final-candidate execution.

Evidence root: `/private/tmp/sifr-item12k-b4.3wWQdN/`.

External owner: [SQL coverage registry blocker](ad-hoc-schema-first-sql-platform-review-follow-ups.md#b4-independent-main-readiness-receipt-2026-09-06),
SQL compiler/schema tools/verification. The same 23 corrections were approved
in Item 12B / #3694 but remain in the retained integration lineage of #3713.
B4's base and candidate have identical classification registry blob
`c835f5e32761a99db1b0d5aaeafb1053c997ad6e` and readiness self-test blob
`71240aa421cb9cfe4d754e1c139ad05f5616e2f7`. All Cargo/compiler inputs and the
coverage checker are unchanged. This explains why main runs 24 negatives,
whereas the retained integrated stack runs 27. No coverage pass is claimed.

Counts: zero initial/remediation Opus reviews, zero provider requests/retries,
zero create-PR gates, zero merge-profile gates, zero merges. No compiler,
lockfile, fixture, workflow, gitlink, or external corpus changed. Changed paths
are the taxonomy checker, its new test file, this phase record, and the SQL
owner's Markdown blocker record. Parent and retained clones remain read-only.

Per the dispatch's external-blocker stop rule, no review or merge follows this
failure. Exact next action belongs to the parent: adjudicate independent B4
qualification against the known SQL dependency or arrange separately owned
prerequisite delivery. A later authorized B4 continuation can then use the
still-unused exact-SHA review allowance. Do not import the retained compiler
stack, resume 12K, or start another item in this worker.
Later nonblocking tooling owner [#3726](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3726)
records existing path-only inventory enforcement and multiple calls per source
line. It is not a new B7 defect, no per-site contract is inferred from line
counts, and it does not change B8/B9 order or authorize integration requalification.

These owners are authorized bounded dependency work. They must not repair the
next owner, restart original12K qualification, merge its inherited stack, or
conduct whole-phase review. Preserve completed and failed evidence accurately.

## Item 12K-B9: formatter preview reference reconciliation (2026-09-06)

Owner: [#3724](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3724). B7 and B8 are
merged and owners #3722/#3723 are closed. The current parent orchestration
summary above and B8 post-merge closure below are carried forward without
importing the original12K integration stack or changing prior history.

The sole implementer owns fresh clone `/private/tmp/sifr-item12k-b9.YGbRNk/sifr`,
branch `codex/item12k-b9-formatter-reference`, independent Git index and sibling
`evidence/`. An explicit actual `origin/main` fetch established base
`a216019057fbb05ccfdc8c846c20ee3ecc7a639d`. Parent's two intentional Markdown
edits and every predecessor checkout/target remain read-only. Only the owned
Ruff submodule is initialized at the unchanged gitlink
`f19957111640fdee8055bfe5b6aa854259344473` for the named manifest check.

Implementation: correct erroneous `pvalidation` spellings to `preview` in two
capability rows and two CLI rows of the formatter rules reference. This restores
both capability names and requirements, both CLI surfaces, and both
`fmt_cli_preview_flags` references: all eight reported failures. The existing
capability/CLI manifests are authoritative and agree with the implementation:

- `crates/sifr/src/formatter_cli.rs` declares mutually exclusive `--preview`
  and `--no-preview` flags.
- `crates/sifr/src/check_and_package_commands.rs` maps explicit flags to an
  optional boolean override; absent flags preserve config selection.
- `crates/sifr_format/src/config.rs` accepts the `preview` config key and
  applies explicit CLI overrides after configuration.
- `crates/sifr_format/src/lib.rs` defaults preview to false and passes the
  selected value to Ruff's `PreviewMode::Enabled` or `PreviewMode::Disabled`.

Only this phase record and `verification/areas/developer_tooling/formatter_rules.md`
change. No formatter mechanism, manifest, checker, fixture, compiler, lockfile,
workflow or gitlink changes are needed. No architecture or roadmap change.

Named validation, run after the complete implementation batch:

- `python3 verification/areas/developer_tooling/check_formatter_rules_manifests.py`
- `python3 verification/areas/developer_tooling/check_formatter_rules_manifests.py --self-test`
- `git diff --check`
- `python3 scripts/check_file_size_guardrails.py`

No additional test command is needed. Zero create-pr or merge-profile gates
under the user's documentation-only rule. One exact-SHA narrow Opus review,
at most one remediation review, with completed atomic response and SHA-keyed
evidence outside the reviewed tree. After the independent normal main merge,
update the owner and this phase record, publish terminal evidence, and stop.
Original12K's one failed gate stays consumed; its unreached suites remain
unreached. No integration requalification, corpus merge or later item is started.

### B9 terminal closure

[PR #3729](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3729) merged normally on
2026-09-06 at 21:02:12 UTC. Exact reviewed and validated candidate:
`36a3f111276eeade52628f2a5e3778d146d31695`; normal merge:
`fc9dbf04727577e93dec397b3570d7cfe4af33d0`. Owner #3724 is closed.
Immediately before merge, explicit actual `origin/main` remained the reviewed
base `a216019057fbb05ccfdc8c846c20ee3ecc7a639d` and the candidate was clean.
The verified merge has that base and candidate as its parents, and its tree
equals the reviewed candidate tree.

All four named checks passed on the exact candidate. Diff validation used
`git diff --check a216019057fbb05ccfdc8c846c20ee3ecc7a639d HEAD` to cover the
committed change. File-size guard: 3757 files, limit 900 lines. The reference
correction covers all eight failures; checker, all four formatter manifests,
`.gitmodules`, Ruff gitlink and compiler/lockfile/fixture/workflow inputs are
unchanged. Changed paths are only this phase record and the formatter reference.

Counts: one initial Opus SATISFIED review, zero blocking findings, zero
remediation reviews, one provider request, zero retries, zero create-pr gates,
zero merge-profile gates, one normal merge. The reviewer reused the existing
validation and ran no further tests. No second gate or review is required for
this post-merge record-only update.

[Full review and validation evidence](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3729#issuecomment-5562147601)
is published outside the reviewed Git tree, keyed by candidate SHA. Raw completed

The review's unrelated pre-existing network HTTP documentation spelling is
recorded as later owner [#3730](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3730).
No correction was started and no mechanism defect or delivery dependency was
established. The cosmetic diff-command observation is clarified above. The
reviewer could not resolve the B8 record in its own clone; this implementer
verified that receipt read-only in the preserved B8 clone before carrying it.
Neither observation needs new implementation or another review.

This closure record is pushed on the owned B9 branch after merge, outside the
approved candidate, with no second main merge. Parent must carry this terminal
receipt into its own orchestration record; parent and predecessor trees remain
untouched. All worker command/review handles completed. Blocker: none. B9 is
closed; stop here. Original12K remains approved/unmerged with its sole failed
gate consumed and unreached suites still unreached. No integration/corpus merge,
requalification, later item or optional follow-up implementation was started.

## Item 12K-B8: SQL integer spelling guard boundary (2026-09-06)

Owner: [#3723](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3723). B7 is merged and
its owner is closed, as recorded above. This section executes only B8; existing
phase history below is preserved. Explicitly fetched `origin/main` and base:
`4faa76803da67d22a2dfffdb81cc63bf16304fe0`.

The sole implementer owns clone `/private/tmp/sifr-item12k-b8.TS6YQA/sifr`,
branch `codex/item12k-b8-sql-compatibility`, independent Git index and sibling
`evidence/`. Parent's two intentional Markdown edits and every predecessor
checkout/target remain read-only. No original12K integration ancestry is imported.

Implementation: recognize the three existing SQL database-integer mapping
expressions in their exact owner paths, and exempt only each external spelling's
matched literal span from `public-bigint`. Require the database representation,
64-bit width, PostgreSQL aliases/signedness, and MySQL sign binding. Every other
match (including on the same line) and every other guard rule remains enforced.
Register the external SQL integer contract in the existing retained-contract
registry. Preserve PostgreSQL/MySQL compiler sources and SQL behavior byte-for-byte.

Named validation, registered before execution and run after implementation:

- `python3 verification/areas/developer_tooling/check_no_pre_v1_compatibility.py`
- `python3 verification/areas/developer_tooling/check_no_pre_v1_compatibility.py --self-test`
- `python3 -m unittest discover -s verification/areas/developer_tooling -p test_no_pre_v1_compatibility.py -v`
- `git diff --check`
- `python3 scripts/check_file_size_guardrails.py`

Focused regressions cover all three real source sites; whitespace and Unicode
offsets; altered database types, widths, aliases and sign bindings; wrong owner
paths; removed Sifr types, spellings and diagnostics across scan roots; same-line,
nearby and intra-expression forbidden matches; other rules; and retained registry
membership. Only the checker, its Python tests, retained-contract registry and
this phase record change. No compiler, lockfile, fixture or workflow changes:
zero create-pr or merge-profile gates per user instruction.

One exact-candidate Opus review is allowed, plus at most one remediation.
Review evidence stays outside the reviewed tree and is published keyed by SHA.
After the independent main merge, update this record and owner, publish the
terminal receipt, and stop. B9 and original12K requalification are not started.

### B8 terminal closure (carried from record af487bd1547b7b6c555505d8ff32a5e0047726b5)

[PR #3727](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3727) merged normally on
2026-09-06 at 20:48:48 UTC. Exact reviewed and validated candidate:
`4eb6426f81db75a8b562cfc0572f26027c37159c`; merge:
`a216019057fbb05ccfdc8c846c20ee3ecc7a639d`. Owner #3723 is closed. Immediately
before merge, actual main remained the reviewed base
`4faa76803da67d22a2dfffdb81cc63bf16304fe0` and the candidate tree was clean.

All five named B8 commands passed on that candidate. Focused suite: 14 tests;
file-size guard: 3757 files, limit 900 lines. SQL source blobs equal the base.
Counts: one initial Opus SATISFIED review, zero blocking findings, zero remediation,
one provider request, zero retries, zero create-pr gates, zero merge-profile gates,
one normal merge. The reviewer reused existing validation without rerunning it.

[Complete review and evidence](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3727#issuecomment-5562074224)
is published outside the reviewed Git tree. Raw review in the B8 root at
`claude.qhVwE9/response.md`, SHA256
`11c613866c433c2d167684835e264ef425bd6a4cacb022208e9d2a2ef0134773`.
Validation manifest in that root at
`evidence/4eb6426f81db75a8b562cfc0572f26027c37159c.validation.json`, SHA256
`36e70faadcd1a343aea2b64f00505ac4cab612784cc6d7b1d5d02f27300243cc`,
records all command/log hashes and the three unchanged SQL source blobs.

Optional reviewer observations are separate later work in
[#3728](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3728): assess rule-local span
metadata only if a second rule needs it, and document the existing root-relative
scan identity if that contract changes. Neither observation establishes a current
defect or a B8/original12K delivery dependency. No follow-up implementation started.

B8's record-only closure was pushed on its owned branch, outside the approved
candidate, with no second main merge, review or gate. It is carried here as
required by that handoff. B8 blocker: none; all command/review handles completed.

## Item 12K-B7: direct filesystem inventory restoration (2026-09-06)

Owner: [#3722](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3722). This section
executes only B7 from the copied orchestration registration above; historic
main records below are preserved. Latest remote main was fetched and verified
as `f11e1cd7eef16a02063555bccc9fd8e19287833b` before implementation.

Sole implementer owns clone `/private/tmp/sifr-item12k-b7.afEJYk/sifr`, branch
`codex/item12k-b7-inventory`, its independent Git index, and sibling `evidence/`.
Parent and predecessor checkouts remain read-only. No integration ancestry is
required for this independent documentation correction.

Implementation: restore all six missing paths and 22 matching source lines in
`internal_docs/typescript_go_architecture_transfer_guardrails.md`, using exact
main line references. Classify five inline-test lines separately from 17
production lines, retain inline-test scanning and every existing exclusion,
and distinguish CLI execution/sandbox effects, generated outputs, package/build
identity inputs, and unresolved SQL editor provider/snapshot obligations.
Path membership is the existing automated enforcement boundary; row ownership
is not a blanket exemption. No checker mechanism change or new regression
command is necessary.

Named validation, after the implementation batch:

- `python3 verification/areas/developer_tooling/check_typescript_go_transfer_guardrails.py`
- `python3 verification/areas/developer_tooling/check_typescript_go_transfer_guardrails.py --self-test`
- `git diff --check`
- `python3 scripts/check_file_size_guardrails.py`

Only inventory and phase Markdown change. Per the item and user rules, no
create-pr or merge-profile gate is required. One initial exact-SHA Opus review
and at most one remediation remain available before review; results will be
published outside the reviewed tree, followed by the merged receipt here.
B8, B9, original12K qualification, and later emitted-code work are not started.

## Item 12K-B2: canonical diagnostic reference identity (2026-09-06)

Owner: [#3704](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3704), OPEN at dispatch.
This section carries the parent's "Item12K-B1 receipt and B2/B3 dispatch
(2026-09-06)" authorization into this independently owned checkout before
implementation. Scope is the complete canonical reference matcher and focused
positive/negative regressions, preserving unknown/non-active rejection and
required registry coverage. SQL enum renaming, suppression, weaker assertions,
schema synchronization (#3705 / B3), TypeVar follow-ups (#3703), inherited 12K
integration, residual Item 12, and whole-phase closure are outside this item.

The sole live implementer owns `/private/tmp/sifr-item12kb2.Qb9aoe/sifr`, its
index and branch `codex/item12k-b2-diagnostic-reference-identity`, and sibling
temporary evidence paths. Parent checkout/index/targets and all old worker
checkouts remain read-only. Fresh main base is
`4ce05473f58716a611ac190581bf0737ba15331e`. Its checker, MySQL analyzer, and
SQLite lib blobs independently match the B1 receipt:
`adea5eb1e4f7779b41a00fdba797d8ae9c044d18`,
`5bb486b4a5f5086bfc0e420de3713f322dad38ff`, and
`5c608cd22f031675273428e13f8e2f250513d8b5`, respectively.
No inherited integration commits are included.

[B1 terminal evidence](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3702#issuecomment-5558641648)
and [B1 review](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3702#issuecomment-5558355686)
were read along with the full B2 issue and terminal comment. B1 approved
`a42545f759fac4e5e0537b6f9d9cc2fb8c9ed233`, record
`d7c41463ca88d5993e3bc3fa847806160799e147`, remains preserved in
`/private/tmp/sifr-item12kb1.nnPBDD/sifr`: one satisfied review, zero remediation,
one failed gate, no merge. Its inherited integration/corpus lineage remains
unchanged. Original 12K has zero reviews/gates consumed; previous exhausted
allowances are not reset or reused as B2 evidence.

Registered named checks, to run after the complete bounded implementation:

- `python3 verification/areas/diagnostics/checks/code_coverage.py`
- `python3 verification/areas/diagnostics/checks/code_coverage_test.py`
  (canonical names, provider/prefixed identifiers, whole member tokens,
  unknown/non-active canonical rejection, and required registry use)
- `python3 scripts/check_file_size_guardrails.py`
- `python3 -m py_compile verification/areas/diagnostics/checks/code_coverage.py verification/areas/diagnostics/checks/code_coverage_test.py`
- Review the phase-record diff and run `git diff --check` (also check the
  committed base-to-candidate diff).

Only checker/tests/docs changes are planned: skip create-PR and merge gates.
Do not run the known-failing full diagnostics area; schema_sync is B3-owned.
If a compiler/lockfile/fixture/workflow change proves necessary in scope,
record why and run at most one merge-profile gate on the approved final SHA.
One initial exact-base/exact-candidate Opus review and at most one remediation
are authorized, using atomic completed-response evidence outside the approved
tree, keyed by candidate SHA. No review polling or third review. A new mechanism
defect on second review or external blocker must be recorded under its later
owner, then stop. Normal edits, Claude execution, PR/push/merge and owner-issue
updates are authorized. After the narrow merge and record update, stop.

### B2 terminal receipt

Status: **merged and closed**. [PR #3706](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3706)
merged on 2026-09-06 at 10:47:22 UTC as
`770f1ab86050bc95abf05573b39c8c6d5238902e`; owner #3704 is CLOSED.
Exact reviewed and validated implementation:
`8be5b9ece92703fda44149bb79ec6ed077e23c10`; exact base:
`4ce05473f58716a611ac190581bf0737ba15331e`. The base and candidate were
unchanged immediately before merge. This post-merge documentation-only receipt
is retained on the owned branch; its commit SHA is published in the terminal
PR/issue evidence, outside the implementation it records.

Changed paths relative to base:

- `verification/areas/diagnostics/checks/code_coverage.py`: one exact-owner,
  complete-constant-token extractor shared by source and active-list scans.
- `verification/areas/diagnostics/checks/code_coverage_test.py`: 11 focused
  regressions, including real unknown/non-active and required-use rejection.
- `plans/issues/active/ad-hoc-emitted-rust-excellence.md`: authorization and
  terminal record only.

[Named validation evidence](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3706#issuecomment-5558694390)
covers the exact implementation SHA: direct code coverage exits 0 without
diagnostics; focused tests pass 11/11; file-size guardrail passes 3755 files;
Python syntax, phase-record review and working-tree/base-to-candidate diff
checks pass. No compiler, lockfile, fixture or workflow changed. Create-PR
gates: **0**; merge gates: **0**, explicitly skipped under B2 authorization.
No full diagnostics-area pass is claimed; schema_sync was neither run nor
investigated. Documentation-only receipt checks do not rerun implementation
validation or consume another review/gate.

[Initial exact-SHA Opus review](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3706#issuecomment-5558708053):
**SATISFIED**, no blocking findings. Reviews: **1 initial, 0 remediation**;
provider requests: **1 successful, 0 failed**. Atomic completed response:
`/private/tmp/sifr-item12kb2.Qb9aoe/opus-8be5b9ece92703fda44149bb79ec6ed077e23c10.RIKxmf/response.md`,
SHA256 `36f9c0915e2fc2151feb11fc7dcbd2517cf3706cd00040a9d0dbfbf659a8b23b`.
All logs remain outside the approved tree under
`/private/tmp/sifr-item12kb2.Qb9aoe/`, keyed by implementation SHA; their hashes
are published with the named evidence. The review's read-only corpus comparison
found 25 files losing only spurious matches, zero real registry names lost,
and zero newly gained names. Approval covers B2 alone.

Nonblocking findings have concrete later owners:

- [#3707](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3707),
  `compiler/package-management`: pre-existing identifier matcher in the
  separate Rust-interop outcome checker. Recorded, no implementation started.
- [#3708](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3708),
  `compiler/diagnostics`: pre-existing textual comment/string matching policy
  and optional isolation of test filesystem paths. Recorded, no implementation
  started; these are not B2 blockers or B3 requirements.

Blocker: **none**. Parent and old worker checkouts/indexes/targets remain
unmodified. B1's approved stacked checkpoint, review and failed-gate counts
are preserved; original 12K still has zero reviews/gates consumed. No B3,
12K integration, residual Item 12, or whole-phase closure work was started.
Exact next action for this worker: stop after publishing this receipt. The
separately dispatched B3 owner handles #3705 in another session.

## B4 qualified-context continuation registration (2026-09-06)

This sole live worker owns `/private/tmp/sifr-item12k-b4-qualified.X1Lz43/sifr`
on branch `codex/item12k-b4-qualified`. All parent and prior-worker checkouts,
indexes and targets remain read-only; the parent's two dirty Markdown files
are intentional. The following dispatch and superseding adjudication are copied
from the parent before integration work. No review/gate allowance is reset.

### Item12K continuation receipt and B4 dispatch (2026-09-06)

Chandrasekhar is closed. [Draft #3713](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3713)
preserves candidate `fbe5ca93e61c5286268f2b42a768901a907544f4`, final record
`5de50ecafc84ed1fa724e7384ad85689a6925dfb`, base
`f11e1cd7eef16a02063555bccc9fd8e19287833b`, and unchanged corpus
`8bcbe7ab7939e5c8362c10f61a80e368022cc372`. All approved dependency ancestry
and B1/B2/B3 records are retained in the independent clone
`/private/tmp/sifr-item12k-cont.StPW7n/sifr`. Original #3701 is preserved.
[Terminal receipt](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3712#issuecomment-5559080613)
records locked build, all1452 codegen tests,18 focused checker tests and static
guards passing. Authenticated unchanged-input B1 lowering1119/Python30/demo264
evidence was reused, not relabeled as new execution. Fresh readiness is3/4;
driver was interrupted during compilation and is not a pass. Remaining crate
checks/driver filters,90 native cases,411 algorithmic cases,full diagnostics,
strict Clippy and E2E/stdlib qualification remain unreached. Original12K has
zero reviews,zero gates,zero merges; no historical allowance changed.

The user explicitly said Continue after this blocker/status report. Assign a
fresh sole worker to **12K-B4 / [#3712](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3712)**,
owner compiler-verification. Use a fresh independent branch/clone on latest
main for an independently mergeable checker repair, retaining all prior clones,
indexes, targets and parent dirty documents read-only. Carry this authorization
into the owned phase record before implementation.

Scope: correct the fixture/audit path boundary in
`verification/areas/coverage_matrix/checks/verification_taxonomy.py` so labels
outside the governed root cannot invalidate a valid fixture. The reported
self-test inherits TMPDIR; its out-of-repository path classification scans
absolute ancestors and rejects `-item12k` in the worker's containing directory.
Establish and correct the complete owning-boundary mechanism. Retain rejection
of forbidden names in both filenames and governed descendant directories, and
retain the full strict repository/content audit and negative self-tests. Do not
fix this by renaming the worker directory, changing TMPDIR to evade the check,
checking only basenames, broad allowlisting, ignoring assertions, or weakening
the naming policy. Caller-root isolation is the bounded defect; unrelated
taxonomy policy and diagnostics follow-ups stay outside B4.

Finish the whole scoped change before tests. Named checks:
`python3 verification/areas/coverage_matrix/checks/verification_taxonomy.py`;
focused valid/invalid path-boundary regressions under neutral and deliberately
matching caller-ancestor labels (register exact command before running);
`uv run --project verification --locked python -m sifr_verify areas run --area coverage_matrix --suite readiness`
with owned repository-local result-json output, under the formerly failing
ancestor pattern; `python3 scripts/check_file_size_guardrails.py`; relevant
Python syntax, documentation and `git diff --check` checks. Register concrete
owned test directories/output paths without touching the retained failing clone.
No other broad qualification belongs to B4. Report actual four-check readiness
coverage and preserve every prior negative rejection.

One initial exact-SHA Opus review and at most one remediation review. If changes
are checker/tests/docs only with no compiler/lockfile/fixture/workflow change,
skip Sifr create-PR/merge gates. If governed inputs necessarily change within
scope, one exact-approved-SHA merge-profile gate only, skip create-pr for
in-session merge. No second gate or historical allowance reset. Normal narrow
PR/push/merge and owner-record updates are authorized. A new second-review
mechanism or external blocker receives a later owner record and terminal
handoff. After merge/record or blocked handoff, stop; B4 must not start12K.
The next fresh12K worker resumes record5de50ec with merged B4 and reusable
evidence, finishes pending qualification, then uses its still-unused review/gate.
No whole-phase review or12D/E/F/Item12/12A work belongs to B4.

### B4 prerequisite-context adjudication (2026-09-06)

Gauss is closed. [B4 receipt](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3712#issuecomment-5559781114)
preserves implementation `eaa4a063b69ee2132bef55514361062e85db3548`, record
`a3cf7620088a3fda9c0935fbf29f511ac862f1f3`, draft#3714 in
`/private/tmp/sifr-item12k-b4.3wWQdN/sifr`. Direct taxonomy under the formerly
failing ancestor, eight focused tests, file-size/syntax/docs checks pass.
The complete readiness invocation on independent main passes taxonomy,
19-row profile assignment and the24 negative cases actually present there,
but fails23 SQL classifications. This is the existing SQL prerequisite already
approved in12B and present in preserved12K/#3713, not a new unimplemented SQL
mechanism. The failed independent-main result remains a failure; do not relabel
it as the integrated27-case evidence. B4 used zero reviews and zero gates.

Adjudication: a fresh B4-only worker may qualify the existing B4 patch on the
already assembled12K prerequisite context. Create an owned clone/branch retaining
12K record `5de50ecafc84ed1fa724e7384ad85689a6925dfb` and merge/preserve B4's
implementation/record lineage there. Compare current main for relevant changes.
This supersedes the earlier B4 restriction against importing the retained stack
for prerequisite qualification only. No new SQL implementation or duplicate
classification repair is authorized or needed. B4 owns only its checker,
regressions and records; inherited compiler/corpus implementation remains12K.
Any genuine integration conflict in B4-owned files is in scope, not wider12K work.

Finish any bounded corrections before running the same B4 named commands in
the combined context, preserving intentionally matching caller-root labels.
The full four-check readiness suite must pass with its actual integrated
negative-case count. Use repository-local result-json paths. Reuse unchanged
focused evidence with explicit complete-input comparison; never substitute a
neutral directory workaround. Then use B4's still-unused initial exact-SHA Opus
review, plus at most one remediation. Reviewer gets exact integrated base,
candidate and B4 delta, explicitly excluding approval of inherited compiler
changes. Publish both source lineage and qualification-input provenance.

If the B4 delta remains checker/tests/docs only, no Sifr gate: inherited12K
compiler files do not become a new B4 implementation change. Do not run12K's
gate or review here. Preserve the qualified, reviewed B4 checkpoint as a linked
stacked dependency when an independent merge cannot retain exact-input evidence;
return that explicit integration dependency rather than merging the unreviewed
compiler stack. The next fresh12K worker incorporates this approved B4 lineage
and completes original integration qualification/review/merge under its unused
allowances. No additional B4 review cycle, SQL item, standalone failed-main
readiness retry or whole-phase review is created by this adjudication.
Stop after B4 reviewed handoff/merge or a genuinely new external blocker.

### Owned qualification paths and exact commands

Integrated prerequisite base: `5de50ecafc84ed1fa724e7384ad85689a6925dfb`
(candidate `fbe5ca93e61c5286268f2b42a768901a907544f4`, draft #3713).
B4 source: `eaa4a063b69ee2132bef55514361062e85db3548`, record
`a3cf7620088a3fda9c0935fbf29f511ac862f1f3`, draft #3714.
GitHub main verified at `f11e1cd7eef16a02063555bccc9fd8e19287833b`;
there are no newer main changes to integrate. Preserve both source ancestries
with a normal merge in this clone, including any record-only conflict resolution.

Every command below runs from this owned clone with
`TMPDIR=/private/tmp/sifr-item12k-b4-qualified.X1Lz43/caller-tmp`.
The `-item12k` ancestor intentionally retains the formerly failing condition.
`TAXONOMY_TEST_TMPDIR` is unset. Cache and bytecode output are owned:
`UV_CACHE_DIR=/private/tmp/sifr-item12k-b4-qualified.X1Lz43/uv-cache`,
`PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX=/private/tmp/sifr-item12k-b4-qualified.X1Lz43/pycache`.
Logs go under `/private/tmp/sifr-item12k-b4-qualified.X1Lz43/evidence/`.
The readiness JSON is
`target/verification/areas/b4-qualified-readiness.json` inside this clone.

```bash
python3 verification/areas/coverage_matrix/checks/verification_taxonomy.py
python3 verification/areas/coverage_matrix/checks/test_verification_taxonomy_paths.py

git diff --check 5de50ecafc84ed1fa724e7384ad85689a6925dfb HEAD
```

Read changed records for documentation consistency. Execute the eight focused
tests in the integrated context; do not relabel the old 24-negative main result.
Require all four readiness checks and confirm the actual 27 negative cases.
No compiler/native/Python-interop/diagnostics validation or Sifr gate belongs
to this checker/tests/docs-only B4 delta. Review only B4 and its interaction
with this exact context; the inherited compiler stack stays outside approval.
If independent merge cannot retain these exact inputs, preserve the reviewed
stacked checkpoint and linked PR for a fresh 12K owner, then stop.

Later [12K-B4/#3712](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3712) belongs to
`compiler-verification`, separately from diagnostics follow-up3708. The unchanged
checker creates self-test fixtures under caller TMPDIR, then scans every
absolute-path ancestor for out-of-repository files. The regex matches `-item12k`
in this worker's registered `sifr-item12k-cont.StPW7n` ancestor, rejecting valid
`semantic_terms.rs` independently of content. Main/B1/candidate share checker
blob `0d67883ab670bf0e199fd4fe88602b4b7d62bf7b`. A read-only filename

Parent and retained checkouts/indexes/targets/dirty records stayed read-only.

Integration completed on main `f11e1cd7eef16a02063555bccc9fd8e19287833b`.
Normal merge commits preserve both B2/B3 post-merge records. Only a Markdown
insertion conflict required resolution; both records were retained. Relative
to approvedB1, the exhaustive Git diff contains exactly the phase Markdown,
diagnostics schema, code_coverage.py/code_coverage_test.py and
schema_sync.py/test_schema_sync.py. No compiler, runtime, lockfile, Python
source/fixture/manifest/runner, demo, toolchain configuration or gitlink changed.

Direct B2/B3 focused checks and complete diagnostics are registered above because
the integrated compiler sources differ from standalone B2/B3 qualification.

Merge plan: create a linked replacement integration PR from this fresh branch;
retain original3701 and all historical commits. After exact-candidate review
and the single passing gate, use normal GitHub merge commits for corpus48 and
the replacement Sifr PR, verifying expected heads and unchanged bases first.
The qualified corpus source8bcbe7a remains the pinned gitlink and an ancestor
of the corpus merge; do not repin it to the merge commit after qualification.
Sifr's candidate contains latest main, so a normal merge preserves its tree.
Post-merge phase/owner records are separate documentation-only evidence.

This is the original 12K continuation, with zero initial reviews, zero
remediation reviews and zero gates used; no predecessor allowance is reset.
The sole live worker owns independent clone `/private/tmp/sifr-item12k-cont.StPW7n/sifr`,

Verify B2/B3 exact checker locations before invocation; correct registration
before execution if needed. Reuse B1/B2/B3 passes only after complete-input
provenance comparison, with explicit hashes. Full Python30/30 includes all five
named suites; do not repeat unchanged expensive coverage. Demo update's full
byte comparison can cover check. Readiness runs its four checks without duplicate
standalone invocations. Adapt only native script roots outside Git, preserving
90 cases, compiler/source/corpus hashes, native assertions and worker policy.
Canonical algorithmic suite must qualify411 cases. No filtered certification,
warm-cache performance claim, blind baseline regeneration or failure allowlist.

After prerequisite qualification, one exact-base/candidate read-only Opus review,
at most one remediation, then one merge-profile gate on the approved exact SHA;
skip create-pr, no second gate. Publish SHA-keyed completed review outside Git.
Inspect disk/private target before long Cargo gate. Full E2E and migrated stdlib
runtime coverage count only if actual gate lanes pass. A confirmed external
blocker or second-review new mechanism receives a later owner and terminal
checkpoint; stop without repairing it. H/I/M1 followups and issues3703/3707/3708/
3710/3711 remain outside this item. After successful merges and phase/owner
receipt, stop. No12D/E/F, retainedItem12,12A or whole-phase work.

## Item12K-B1 dispatch and ownership (2026-09-06)

The user authorizes this fresh sole implementer to close only the separately
owned [TypeVar assertion-fidelity issue #3667](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3667).
Parent orchestration and its two dirty documents are read-only. All former
worker checkouts, indexes, and targets remain read-only. This session owns
`/private/tmp/sifr-item12kb1.nnPBDD/sifr`, its independent Git index, private
target and temporary evidence root, and `codex/item12k-b1-typevar-fidelity`.
It starts at record `23088af50c8e25014c44262b8a7ec1f11dfbe09c`, preserving
integrated candidate `7e23785ab07cba6f925eed2f934c0304750f1d74`, all original
dependency commits and corpus `8bcbe7ab7939e5c8362c10f61a80e368022cc372`.
Fetched main remains `4ce05473f58716a611ac190581bf0737ba15331e`; no base change
requires reintegration. The issue is open and confirms the intended wording
change in producer `066300ff185f38b425a884a2225b72990a194e58`.

Scope: update only the two stale exact message expectations in
`crates/sifr_lowering/src/lower/expressions_tests/control_flow_and_strings.rs`.
Preserve diagnostic codes, primary ranges, negative inputs, and exact equality;
no generic/language semantics change, weakened matching, ignored tests, or
producer-wording restoration. The producer accepts qualified type names after
the cited change, explaining removal of "simple". No additional assertion
correction has been identified. The unchanged keyword-constraints producer
wording belongs to a different branch and is outside this repair.

Implement the complete correction before running only these named checks:

- `cargo test -p sifr_lowering test_typevar_invalid_bound_shape_has_primary_range`
- `cargo test -p sifr_lowering test_pep695_typevar_constraint_shape_has_primary_range`
- `cargo test -p sifr_lowering`
- `cargo fmt --check`
- `python3 scripts/check_hir_maintainability_guardrails.py`
- `python3 scripts/check_file_size_guardrails.py`
- relevant documentation/diff checks.

One exact-SHA initial Opus review and at most one remediation review apply
only to B1. After approval, one `scripts/run_all_tests.sh --profile merge`
on that exact candidate is authorized because compiler-tree tests change;
skip create-pr and never repeat the gate. Check free disk and the private target
before the gate. Do not clean old/shared targets. A new mechanism defect on
second review or an external gate failure receives a later owner record and
terminal handoff, without unrelated repair.

Ordinary push, a narrowly linked stacked draft PR, merge, and issue/phase
updates are authorized. The B1 review cannot approve the unreviewed 12K stack
or reset any historical dependency allowance. If an independent merge cannot
retain valid exact-input evidence, preserve the approved bounded correction
for fresh 12K continuation and return blocked. Do not start that continuation.
The parent's authorization of fresh sequential workers through phase closure
is orchestration authority; this worker stops after B1. Full-phase Opus belongs
only to the future 12A closer.

### Item12K-B1 terminal checkpoint: approved correction, external gate block

State on 2026-09-06: **implemented and reviewed; not merged, not closed**.
The parent's orchestration checkpoint explicitly required the running gate to
finish without interruption or restart. It completed normally with exit 1;
no review/gate allowance was added by that checkpoint.

- Draft [PR #3702](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3702), base
  `23088af50c8e25014c44262b8a7ec1f11dfbe09c`, branch
  `codex/item12k-b1-typevar-fidelity`.
- Reviewed implementation: `a42545f759fac4e5e0537b6f9d9cc2fb8c9ed233`.
  Pre-implementation authorization record: `f418e3ab9`. The only implementation
  change is the two full TypeVar message expectations at lines 493 and 519 of
  `crates/sifr_lowering/src/lower/expressions_tests/control_flow_and_strings.rs`.
  Exact equality, diagnostic code, primary ranges and negative inputs remain.
- Both named focused tests pass (one each). `cargo test -p sifr_lowering`:
  **1119 passed, 0 failed, 1 existing ignored, 0 filtered**; doc tests 0/0.
  Fmt, HIR, file-size (**3777 files, 900-line limit**) and diff checks pass.
  [Published named validation](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3702#issuecomment-5558355579).
- The one initial exact-SHA Opus review returned **SATISFIED**, no blockers;
  no remediation review was used.
  [Published review](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3702#issuecomment-5558355686).
  Raw review SHA256:
  `983fe36c52e8bf29cae4def89c0198644368f4942dca79ff1feccfbb40dab2f0`.
- The sole `scripts/run_all_tests.sh --profile merge` ran on that exact clean
  implementation SHA and exited **1 after 3254.32 seconds**. Create-pr was
  skipped. Pre-gate disk: 181 GiB free; private target: 1.7 GiB; no cleanup.
  No old/shared target was used or cleaned, and no cache-certification bypass
  or profile change was introduced.
- Gate passes: all reached guardrails, 264-companion freshness, Rust interop
  **10/10**, coverage readiness **4/4**, core language **5/5**, CPython
  differential **2/2**, and Python interop **30/30** (including native callback,
  dataframe, buffer, Arrow, DLPack, ML, library, async and runtime checks).
  This is B1-candidate execution evidence, not retroactive approval of 12K.
- Diagnostics reports **184 variants: 182 pass, 2 blocking failures**.
  All **179 baseline variants pass**. The two `rules` failures are separately
  owned later work: **12K-B2 / [#3704](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3704)**
  for the canonical diagnostic matcher misreading SQL provider enum suffixes
  (314 reported unknown references), and **12K-B3 / [#3705](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3705)**
  for `docs/schemas/diagnostics.schema.json` synchronization drift. Relevant
  checker/model/schema sources match fetched main; B1 did not change them.
  The schema drift mechanism is not established by the retained report.
  Neither failure was repaired or rerun. Later profile stages are unreached.
  The elapsed warm budget was exceeded (advisory); no performance pass is claimed.
- Opus's non-blocking wording/parity and additional positional-diagnostic
  coverage suggestions are recorded in [#3703](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3703).
  The keyword-constraints branch still accepts only simple names, so its
  existing wording is not treated as a proven stale-message defect.

Evidence root: `/private/tmp/sifr-item12kb1.nnPBDD/`. Named logs are
`{bound,constraint,lowering,fmt,hir,file-size}-a42545f75.log`; the immutable
review response is in
`opus-a42545f759fac4e5e0537b6f9d9cc2fb8c9ed233.Kzvvph/response.md`.
The full gate log is `merge-a42545f759fac4e5e0537b6f9d9cc2fb8c9ed233.log`,
SHA256 `d17efebc2ad9fb360710c69e0ce65c6a7a03c38caf979461e27c9ab33ce76b80`.

Merge SHA: **none**. B1 is stacked on the unreviewed integrated checkpoint;
retargeting its two assertions to main would change validation inputs, while
merging the entire stack would exceed its narrow review. Preserve the approved
correction and all inherited history/corpus for fresh owned continuation.
The original 12K allowance remains **zero reviews and zero gates used**;
all earlier dependency caps remain unchanged. This B1 session used one review,
zero remediation reviews and one failed gate, and stops after its record-only
handoff. Next action belongs to a fresh owner: resolve the recorded diagnostics
dependencies under their own scope, then resume the preserved 12K qualification.
No later item, schema regeneration, matcher repair, integration redo, or
whole-phase review was started here. Issue #3667 remains open pending merge.

## Objective

Make every Rust program emitted by Sifr correct, panic-safe, idiomatic,
efficient, portable, and clean under the repository's strongest generated-code
quality policy.

This is a full-solution phase. It does not preserve known emitter debt behind
lint allowances, checked-in stale output, corpus exclusions, compatibility
paths, silent fallbacks, or deferred quality tiers.

## Source of Truth

- this phase record
- `verification/areas/generated_code_quality/emitted_rust_audit_inventory.json`
- `verification/areas/generated_code_quality/check_emitted_rust_audit_inventory.py`
- the compiler and runtime sources that produce generated Rust
- every compiler-generated Rust surface reached through `emit`, `build`,
  `run`, `test`, single-file, project, static-program, sysroot, and interop
  entrypoints
- generated demo companions and verification-generated Cargo projects

The inventory reconciles the internal review with the external audit supplied
by the user. A claim marked `rejected` is preserved to prevent it from being
reintroduced as an unsupported requirement. A `confirmed` or
`partially_confirmed` claim has exactly one implementation owner.

## Locked Quality Contract

### Semantic correctness

1. Emitted Rust preserves the canonical Sifr language and stdlib semantics in
   debug and release profiles.
2. Integer arithmetic, floor division, modulo, conversion, and fixed-width
   boundaries use one exact and explicit model. Compiler optimization must not
   change observable overflow behavior.
3. Collection reads, writes, deletes, unpacking, and mutation use one checked
   access architecture. Missing and out-of-range operations return the typed
   Sifr error required by the source contract.
4. Iterators and generators preserve laziness, termination, error timing, and
   infinite-source behavior. No finite cap can stand in for an infinite
   iterator.
5. Stdlib adapters preserve error categories, argument semantics, precision,
   Unicode behavior, and resource limits.

### Runtime safety

1. User data cannot reach Rust panic, abort, process exit, undefined behavior,
   capacity overflow, indexing panic, arithmetic panic, or an impossible-state
   macro.
2. `unwrap`, `expect`, `panic!`, `unreachable!`, `abort`, and `exit` are not
   generated as error handling. A compiler-proven invariant must be represented
   structurally or converted to a checked internal diagnostic before generated
   code materialization.
3. `unsafe` is forbidden in emitted user crates unless a future phase record
   approves one audited, encapsulated runtime implementation. No such approval
   exists in this phase.
4. Silent no-op writes and fallback values are forbidden when the Sifr contract
   requires an error.

### Rust quality

1. Generated Rust passes `rustfmt --check` without first mutating the files.
2. Generated crates pass the strongest agreed Clippy policy with warnings
   denied. Every allowance must identify a language-driven necessity, an owner,
   and removal criteria. Allowances for emitter convenience are forbidden.
3. Public and private APIs use `str`, slices, iterators, references, owned
   values, and standard collection entry APIs according to Rust ownership
   norms.
4. Emission contains no redundant clones, identity maps, needless returns,
   unreachable tails, constant dead branches, one-character `String`
   allocations, or scaffolding that a structured Rust IR can avoid.
5. Generated names remain deterministic and legal without globally suppressing
   ordinary Rust naming and dead-code diagnostics.

### Performance and portability

1. Compiler lowering must not turn an asymptotically efficient source program
   into a worse algorithm through cloning, indexing, front removal, eager
   materialization, or Unicode rescans.
2. Runtime and stdlib support is demand-driven and emitted once. Duplicate
   bridges, duplicate APIs, and dead support modules are forbidden.
3. Generated Cargo projects contain no machine-specific absolute paths in
   distributable output. Build-local paths may exist only in ephemeral build
   state that is never presented as portable emitted source.
4. Process APIs preserve argument boundaries. The compiler does not introduce
   shell parsing or command concatenation that was absent from the source API.
5. Full-corpus qualification records generated source size, relevant operation
   counts, lint allowances, and selected complexity budgets so quality cannot
   regress while tests remain behaviorally green.

## Scope

### In scope

- `crates/sifr_codegen/**`
- generated-project materialization in `crates/sifr_driver/**`
- generated runtime support in `crates/sifr_runtime/**` and sysroot-owned
  support used by emitted programs
- generated-code verification adapters, manifests, negative seeds, profiles,
  and evidence
- checked-in generated demo companions and stale generated snapshots
- generated Cargo manifests and bridge assembly
- focused language, stdlib, e2e, algorithmic, and performance fixtures needed
  to prove each mechanism

### Out of scope

- rewriting hand-authored `idiomatic.rs` reference files
- changing Sifr semantics merely to make Rust emission easier
- hand-editing generated output as the fix instead of correcting its producer
- general compiler architecture work with no emitted-code acceptance effect
- user-authored shell commands whose injection risk is already present in the
  source-level API and is not introduced by lowering

An out-of-scope defect found during implementation is recorded with an owner.
It does not broaden the active item.

## Execution Rules

1. Work one item at a time in the order below.
2. Implement the complete item before running its tests. Then run focused
   validation, repair failures in scope, and collect exact-SHA evidence.
3. Each implementation item receives one exact-SHA agent review and at
   most one remediation review. A second-review mechanism defect becomes a
   later owned item; there is no third review.
4. Compiler-changing items receive exactly one create-PR gate and one merge
   gate on the final candidate SHA. Neither gate is repeated. Items without
   compiler changes omit both gates. For this phase, the user authorizes the
   following narrow ordering override: run the constituent pre-review checks,
   open the draft PR, complete the exact-SHA review/remediation sequence, and
   only then run the named create-PR and merge gates once on the resulting
   final SHA. This preserves the draft-PR review workflow while ensuring both
   named gates qualify exactly the code that can merge.
   Item 8 has one explicitly adjudicated exception: its reviewed SHA
   `a77acce704ccab8bf568ea4156ff05dd706c66c1` exposed a missing
   `sifr_runtime::count_byte` manifest owner in the sole create-PR gate. The
   user authorized documentation-only manifest commit
   `fa661c6eccd4c1fa3eb0092e3106ac4d44dddeda`, the targeted guard passed, and
   neither the review nor create-PR gate was repeated. This is not precedent
   for another item or another gate mismatch.
5. Merge the item, update this record, and start the next unfinished item.
6. The closure-only final item receives the only whole-phase agent review.
7. Before each item starts, rebase its branch point on current `origin/main`
   and re-audit any relevant mechanism that another merged phase changed.
   Unmerged branches are not silently treated as delivered work.
8. Generated companions are regenerated from the candidate compiler. They are
   never manually polished.
9. Generated-code lint debt is exact evidence, not a name-based tolerance.
   Each retained diagnostic is selected by companion, lint name, count, and
   stable signature. Unknown diagnostics, count growth, signature drift, and
   diagnostics outside the recorded companion selection fail closed. Item 12
   must remove the remaining owned debt rather than rebase it.
10. A named one-shot gate that identifies an in-scope candidate defect stops
    the item for explicit adjudication. The defect is not deferred, waived, or
    hidden by changing the gate, and the one-shot gate is not rerun.

## Sequential Items

| Item | Status | Name | Required outcome |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 0 | complete | Contract and audit inventory lock | The full quality contract, reconciled finding ledger, baseline, ownership, review limits, and closure rules are machine checked and merged. |
| 1 | complete | Comprehensive corpus and non-vacuous gates | Every generated surface is discoverable; freshness, rustfmt, Clippy, panic/static analysis, determinism, and negative self-tests fail closed without broad quality suppressions. |
| 2 | complete | Exact integer and overflow architecture | Canonical `int` storage and all arithmetic use one exact semantic model; debug/release behavior agrees; fixed-width boundaries remain explicitly checked. |
| 3 | complete | Checked failure and impossible-state model | Generated user paths use typed errors; abort/exit/unreachable discharge and silent value fallbacks are removed; compiler invariants fail before materialization. |
| 4 | merged | Collection access and mutation architecture | Reads, writes, deletes, nested access, augassign, membership, and unpacking share checked place semantics with no panic or silent no-op path. |
| 4A | merged | Residual checked-place lifecycle closure | Loop-carried witnesses, post-mutation missing behavior, and callback argument decoding preserve exact semantics and compile on every generated surface. |
| 4B | merged | Structured-loop witness state closure | Async-for guard state cannot escape a possibly empty loop, and missing loop-carried witnesses take the loop-kind's terminating control-flow path instead of skipping progress. |
| 4C | merged | Mutation-tail witness continuation closure | Refreshed witnesses use region-scoped continuations and current typed failure semantics across nested and straight-line mutation tails. |
| 5 | merged | Lazy iterator and generator architecture | Yield, generator state, `count`, `islice`, chained adapters, and errors are lazy and semantically unbounded where required. |
| 6 | merged | Stdlib emitted-semantics closure | String widths, IO reads/seeks/errors, decimal precision, iteration arguments, and every inventory-owned stdlib defect have exact behavior and resource safety. |
| 6A | merged | Generic-bound substitution and residual string parity | Generic arithmetic bounds use receiving-parameter identity and `str.center` matches CPython's odd-margin behavior. |
| 7 | merged | Ownership, borrowing, and clone quality | Signatures and expressions use idiomatic borrowing; avoidable container, row, tree, and scalar clones are eliminated without weakening ownership safety. |
| 7A | merged | Receiver-effect precision and owned-boundary closure | Receiver effects invalidate only facts they can falsify and every `setdefault` entrypoint shares one owned-value boundary. |
| 7B | merged | End-relative receiver facts and affine boundary closure | Growth invalidates end-relative facts without discarding stable absolute facts, and affine `setdefault` has one checked ownership contract. |
| 8 | merged | Canonical Rust IR and emission cleanup | Structured IR represents all maintained code; dead branches/tails, identity transforms, needless returns, stale snapshots, and generated ceremony are removed at the producer. |
| 8A | merged | Canonical cleanup effect and identity hardening | Every second-review cleanup edge is effect-, type-, scope-, and concurrency-safe, with one shared format-capture mechanism and no target invalidation between concurrent quality runs. |
| 9 | merged | Algorithmic and Unicode performance | Emission preserves source complexity; string traversal avoids repeated scans/materialization; collection algorithms avoid quadratic clone/front-removal behavior; budgets prevent recurrence. |
| 9A | merged | Character comparison state disambiguation | Allocation-free character/string comparison keeps an absent indexed character distinct from a present empty or multi-character string in every operand and optionality form. |
| 10 | merged | Runtime, stdlib bridge, and API deduplication | Each demanded support body and public adapter is assembled once, unused support is absent, and generated crates have one canonical API path per operation. |
| 10A | merged | Module-scoped builtin error shadow identities | Project support demand preserves user-defined and builtin error identities per module, without crate-wide suppression or dangling generated paths. |
| 11 | merged | Portable and secure generated projects | Reviewed candidate `78c28c1e4c42bd85d685d3a3cffdf132fcdfcc40` is preserved and merged through Item 11A after its consumed gate's stale companions were regenerated. |
| 11A | merged | Generated-companion freshness and Item 11 integration | The reviewed Item 11 candidate and all 15 compiler-regenerated companions are merged through a separately bounded review and gate without rerunning Item 11's consumed gate. |

## Item Acceptance Contracts

### Item 0: Contract and audit inventory lock

- [x] Every internal and external audit mechanism is confirmed, partially
  confirmed, or rejected with evidence.
- [x] Every actionable finding has exactly one owner in Items 1-11.
- [x] The checker rejects missing ownership, invalid status, duplicate IDs,
  invalid item references, and unsupported rejected claims.
- [x] The Item 0 mutation self-test proves its implemented rejection classes;
  the sole remediation review's newly identified missing branches are owned by
  Item 1 under the no-third-review rule.
- [x] The roadmap names this active phase.
- [x] The exact-SHA review process followed the initial/remediation limit, its
  new mechanism defect is assigned to Item 1, and the item is merged.

### Item 1: Comprehensive corpus and non-vacuous gates

- [x] Corpus discovery covers all generated entrypoint classes and cannot be
  reduced without a failing self-test.
- [x] Checked-in generated files are fresh or are removed as non-authoritative.
- [x] `rustfmt --check` runs before any formatter mutation.
- [x] Clippy warnings are denied without emitter-convenience blanket allows.
- [x] Static safety analysis covers impossible-state macros, termination calls,
  indexing, casts, allocation widths, arithmetic, and generated `allow` use.
- [x] Negative seeds prove each gate can fail for the owned defect class.
- [x] The audit-inventory self-test covers every validation branch, including
  empty item/baseline containers and both required finding text fields.
- [x] Baseline provenance requires its named command, toolchain, and note keys.
- [x] Evidence rows use governed semantic anchors, not path existence alone;
  glob and repository-boundary handling fails closed.

### Item 2: Exact integer and overflow architecture

- [x] `int` has one canonical runtime representation through locals,
  parameters, returns, fields, containers, constants, unions, and interop.
- [x] All arithmetic and conversions preserve the language's exact semantics.
- [x] Floor division/modulo and zero/overflow errors are consistent.
- [x] Debug and release differential/property evidence agrees.

### Item 3: Checked failure and impossible-state model

- [x] No generated user path contains abort, exit, unreachable, panic, unwrap,
  expect, or a silent fallback for an error-producing operation.
- [x] Compiler invariants are validated structurally before source rendering.
- [x] Typed errors preserve category, payload, source span where applicable,
  and error timing.

### Item 3A: Residual checked-flow and proof mechanism closure

- [x] Suppressible Python context errors rejoin every enclosing try carrier with
  a structurally valid continuation, including direct-return contexts.
- [x] Exact-integer facts distinguish module constants from shadowing locals and
  are invalidated by called nested-function `nonlocal` mutation.
- [x] Sync/async context and loop regressions compile and run with the intended
  dynamic values and no mechanism-owned warning debt.
- [x] Static flow summaries and emitted carriers agree for every repaired path.

### Item 4: Collection access and mutation architecture

- [x] Every collection access form uses one typed checked-place plan.
- [x] Negative indices, nested indices, unpacking cardinality, missing keys,
  deletes, and writes preserve Sifr semantics.
- [x] Membership and read-only access do not mutate containers.
- [x] Out-of-range writes never become no-ops.

### Item 4A: Residual checked-place lifecycle closure

- [x] A checked-place witness does not survive a loop back-edge after any
  mutation of its object or index dependencies.
- [x] A fresh read after mutation uses the operation's current typed failure
  semantics; deletion followed by access cannot replay an earlier guard exit.
- [x] Fixed-arity callback argument decoding is type-directed, panic-free, and
  compiles for one or more callback arguments across the Python interop matrix.

### Item 4B: Structured-loop witness state closure

- [x] Async-for saves and restores sequence-guard state like `for` and `while`,
  so a proof established only in its body cannot escape a zero-iteration loop.
- [x] Loop-carried refresh assigns loop-kind-specific missing control flow:
  `break` for `while` and `continue` for `for`/`async for`, including witnesses
  originally established by an enclosing branch without a missing action.
- [x] Focused diagnostics assert the checked-place error identity rather than
  accepting an arbitrary lowering failure.
- [x] Native regressions cover ordinary and closable async-for refresh, empty
  async-for guard restoration, and terminating `while` behavior after an
  indirect mutable call invalidates a witnessed place.

### Item 4C: Mutation-tail witness continuation closure

- [x] A witness refresh nested under another loop or branch derives control
  flow from its current structured region, never from an outer witness's stored
  `break`, `continue`, return, or fallback payload.
- [x] Straight-line mutation tails cannot silently skip following statements or
  replay proof-establishment exits; mutable-call invalidation exposes the
  operation's current optional/typed-failure contract before codegen.
- [x] Simple and structured loop lowering share one canonical break/loop-else
  marker constructor.
- [x] Native and codegen regressions cover outer `while ... else` with nested
  `for`/`if` mutation and read, straight-line positive-branch mutation tails,
  and condition-refresh loop-else marker emission.

### Item 5: Lazy iterator and generator architecture

- [x] Generator bodies are resumable state machines or an equivalently lazy
  representation, not eager vectors.
- [x] Infinite iterators remain infinite and consumers control termination.
- [x] `islice` and related adapters validate arguments and preserve error timing.
- [x] Laziness, partial consumption, side effects, and memory use have native
  runtime regressions.

### Item 6: Stdlib emitted-semantics closure

- [x] All Item 6 inventory rows are covered by focused differential tests.
- [x] Signed sizes and widths are validated before allocation/casting.
- [x] IO operations honor size/offset arguments and preserve error kinds.
- [x] Decimal precision never silently falls back.

### Item 6A: Generic-bound substitution and residual string parity

- [x] Propagated arithmetic bounds refer to the caller's corresponding type
  parameter, never a callee-local spelling.
- [x] Differently named `Addable` forwarding compiles and runs through an
  authoritative emitted companion.
- [x] Bound propagation remains demand-driven and preserves the Item 6
  `PartialOrd`, `Display`, and `Hash + Eq` closure.
- [x] `str.center` matches CPython's odd-margin placement as well as signed and
  oversized-width behavior.

### Item 7: Ownership, borrowing, and clone quality

- [x] APIs prefer `str` and slices where ownership is not required.
- [x] Clone insertion is driven by an explicit ownership plan.
- [x] Clone counts and representative emitted shapes have regression budgets.
- [x] Recursive and dynamic-programming fixtures preserve linear work where the
  source algorithm is linear.

### Item 7A: Receiver-effect precision and owned-boundary closure

- [x] One receiver-effect summary distinguishes growth, removal, reordering,
  and value mutation for every builtin and user-defined mutable receiver.
- [x] Length and membership guards survive operations that preserve their proof,
  while shrinking/removing operations and positional reordering invalidate the
  exact facts they can falsify.
- [x] Every `setdefault` emission entrypoint materializes owned key/default
  values at the operation boundary, including local-binding fallback emission.
- [x] Focused shape and native regressions cover guard preservation/invalidation
  and borrowed plus owned `setdefault` values without redundant clones.

### Item 7B: End-relative receiver facts and affine boundary closure

- [x] Growth invalidation distinguishes stable absolute subscript facts from
  end-relative negative-index facts whose referent changes after append/extend.
- [x] Negative-index append/extend regressions reject stale non-`None` facts,
  while nonnegative-index growth preservation remains covered.
- [x] Affine `setdefault` values have one explicit checked contract for both
  insertion and returned-value ownership, with reaching emitted/native evidence.
- [x] Mutable non-collection receiver summaries preserve facts only when the
  receiver type cannot own a relevant sequence fact.

### Item 8: Canonical Rust IR and emission cleanup

- [x] Maintained emission uses structured IR through final rendering.
- [x] Canonical simplification removes dead and identity constructs without
  textual postprocessing.
- [x] Generated names and support items are demand-driven and warning-clean.
- [x] Stale or mislabeled generated snapshots are removed or regenerated by an
  authoritative producer.
- [x] Every retained companion diagnostic is governed by exact companion,
  lint, count, and signature evidence; unknown or growing debt fails closed.

#### Item 8 closure ledger

All rows below were implemented, qualified, reviewed, and merged in Item 8.
Second-review suggestions are deliberately outside this closed ledger and are
owned by Item 8A under the no-third-review rule.

| Row | Deferred mechanism | Producer/evidence | Candidate state |
|---:|---|---|---|
| I8-01 | Three non-authoritative test-project references | `scripts/check_demo_emitted_freshness.py` | Implemented: the exact three references are classified and fail closed if an authoritative `emitted.rs` appears. |
| I8-02 | ERQ-025 stale snapshot wording | `emitted_rust_audit_inventory.json` | Implemented: baseline and current companion counts/roles are distinct. |
| I8-03 | Companion rustfmt/Clippy governance | `generated_code_quality.py`, `quality_policy.py`, `inventory_gates.py` | Qualified in the candidate: all 262 authoritative companions passed; the retained summary passed exact companion-set, lint-owner, count, and signature validation after removing the eliminated `manual_let_else` debt. |
| I8-04 | Dead `SIFR-TYPE-0901` surface | diagnostics registry/render/catalog/docs diffs | Implemented: producer, IR, registry, indexes, and dedicated page are removed; historical references remain explicitly historical. |

| I8-18 | Optional read after invalidation diagnostic | `mutable_call_sequence_guard_tests.rs` | Decision implemented: retain canonical `SIFR-TYPE-0002`-family unsupported-operator reporting for the widened `None | T`; no special proof-history diagnostic is warranted. |
| I8-19 | Return-ending while/else E0317 | `while_else_return_tail.sifr`, canonical control-flow pass | Implemented. |
| I8-20 | Implicit straight-line refresh fallback invariant | `checked_place/control_flow.rs`, `refresh_fallback_rejects_presence_removing_mutations` | Implemented as a checked codegen invariant. |
| I8-21 | Duplicated loop/else scaffolds | canonical loop-control constructors and sync/async/block regressions | Implemented through shared structured control paths. |
| I8-22 | Misclassified `numeric_sentinels` fixture | `e2e/pass/numeric_sentinels.sifr` | Implemented by making the source establish the required checked index proof. |

| I8-36 | Unreachable generic affine `setdefault` branch | lowering ownership contract and `methods/dict.rs` | Implemented with one source-facing owner. |
| I8-37 | Silent affine `setdefault` codegen decline | `methods/dict.rs::setdefault_affine_types_are_an_internal_invariant_violation` | Implemented as an explicit compiler invariant. |

Item 8 also integrates three qualification-discovered producer details without
claiming later-item closure: byte counting uses one optimized runtime primitive
to eliminate generated manual-count ceremony; the stdlib manifest carries the
already-delivered Item 6 ordered-JSON feature in isolated companion builds; and
module assembly invokes canonical demand/import placement. Item 9 still owns
algorithmic budgets, Item 10 still owns the unified runtime/bridge demand graph,
and Item 11 still owns portable materialization.

The schema-1 debt file stored only aggregate signatures, so it could not prove
per-lint ownership. Item 8's schema-2 migration removes every Item 8 lint and
all rustfmt debt, then records the residual later-item lint set as per-lint
counts/signatures. The companion-set selection digest includes every companion
identity, and each merged lint signature includes the contributing companion
identity, count, and diagnostic signature. This is a one-way strengthening of
evidence, not permission to carry changed Item 8 debt.

Compiler candidate `49f375e1619185d76e6cfc3b90d7e20ff786cce0`
passed 1,349 codegen tests, the non-E2E CLI suites, the existing 723-fixture
full E2E pass, direct native execution of the new 724th optional-set-remove
fixture, workspace Clippy for all targets with warnings denied, formatting,
diff hygiene, the 3,726-file size guardrail, HIR maintainability, generated
inventory, panic scans, generated rustfmt, determinism, exact-binary demo
freshness, and intrinsic-panic linting. Exact `origin/main`
`74bbb636744adaacb8c3eca09108b6fff9725357` independently retains only the two
stale TypeVar message assertions owned by #3667 and the stale attached-API
fixture lock owned by #3669.

The authoritative 91-project corpus and 262-companion corpus passed every
individual generated crate. Two isolated companion runs produced byte-identical
summaries with SHA-256
`a00628a95f22967fb52ffe3f119ba819ed29ca1c93fb3e6ffbc0c29e4d83fd65`:
11,324 governed diagnostics across 48 later-item lint families, with merged
diagnostic signature
`5231041489b4043fa7f0239abda8e3192702e1dbfd2e3fc366655be2b8fd4393`.
Two isolated selected full-Clippy runs likewise produced byte-identical
summaries with SHA-256
`42d874ebca265e8260e91c8947274d4770676d07020adf1a3308a00eb2dc17aa`.
The canonical cleanup removed `manual_let_else` from both selections and also
removed `semicolon_if_nothing_returned` and `unnecessary_semicolon` from the
selected corpus. The checked-in schema-2 debt matches the residual summaries
exactly and rejects stale owners, unknown diagnostics, count growth, and
signature drift.

The [initial exact-SHA review](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3668#issuecomment-5517105667)
on `84ebe95b928cfe076d9af21e1bc06c1da3bc08c4` was NOT SATISFIED. Candidate
`49f375e1619185d76e6cfc3b90d7e20ff786cce0` resolves all four blockers: stale
lint owners were removed rather than re-owned; generic callables use canonical
lexical identities rather than bare names; optional `set.remove` normalization
has direct native regression coverage; and every Item 8 lint was eliminated
rather than deferred. The remediation also guards branch-local shadowing and
format captures, rejects globally ambiguous enum-owner rewrites, computes
cross-module constants to a monotonic fixed point, preserves eager/Drop/unknown
effects during cleanup, and fingerprints all producer inputs. The sole
remediation review on exact SHA
`a77acce704ccab8bf568ea4156ff05dd706c66c1` was
[SATISFIED](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3668#issuecomment-5523601034)
with no blockers. Its six non-blocking mechanism findings are owned by Item 8A
and [#3670](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3670).

The sole create-PR gate passed every reached check before finding the missing
`sifr_runtime::count_byte` manifest owner. Under the explicit Item 8 exception,
documentation-only final candidate
`fa661c6eccd4c1fa3eb0092e3106ac4d44dddeda` added that owner and the targeted
allowlist guard passed with 14 direct runtime roots; the create-PR gate and
review were not repeated. The sole merge gate then passed every Item 8
guardrail, including demo freshness and the corrected allowlist, before its
only failure in the unchanged SQL coverage/taxonomy matrix. That existing
qualification defect remains Item 12-owned and the merge gate was not
repeated. [PR #3668](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3668) merged as
`99ec90c15e1dbffd68626fa5f9eaa90528d0624a`.

### Item 8A: Canonical cleanup effect and identity hardening

- [x] Shared branch suffix factoring preserves effects and lexical drop order.
- [x] IR and syntax cleanup share one conservative discardability contract,
  including unknown binary effects.
- [x] Private-field pruning preserves initializer effects and nested-module
  demand.
- [x] Iterator, length, and `None` rewrites require structural/type proof rather
  than method or token names.
- [x] All liveness consumers share one format-capture parser that handles
  width/precision captures.
- [x] Generated Clippy isolation prevents concurrent runs from invalidating a
  shared target while retaining deterministic diagnostics.

### Item 9: Algorithmic and Unicode performance

- [x] Indexed string operations do not repeatedly rescan Unicode text.
- [x] Character comparison does not allocate one-character strings.
- [x] Queue/deque and sorting operations use appropriate Rust structures and
  algorithms.
- [x] Representative corpus cases enforce asymptotic and allocation budgets.

### Item 9A: Character comparison state disambiguation

- [x] Out-of-range indexed characters compare unequal to present empty and
  multi-character strings, and inequality is the exact inverse.
- [x] Both operand orders, literals, variables, optional strings, negative and
  positive out-of-range indices, and valid Unicode scalar matches are covered.
- [x] Two genuinely absent optional values preserve their existing equality
  contract without allocating one-character strings.
- [x] The unrelated `compiler_safety` demo source behavior drift introduced in
  Item 9 is restored or moved under an explicit owner, and its companion is
  regenerated from the corrected source.

### Item 10: Runtime, stdlib bridge, and API deduplication

- [x] Runtime/support demand is computed once and rendered once.
- [x] No generated crate contains duplicate bridge bodies or duplicate public
  operation paths.
- [x] Unused support is absent, and bridge-size budgets catch recurrence.

### Item 10A: Module-scoped builtin error shadow identities

- [x] A user-defined error class keeps its exact module-qualified identity.
- [x] A builtin error referenced by a sibling module remains present even when
  another module shadows its bare name.
- [x] Late file-derived support demand is module-aware and cannot turn a
  per-module shadow into a crate-wide suppression veto.
- [x] Single-file, project, and generated test-project paths share the corrected
  identity and demand contract.
- [x] The flat generated-support trait invariant is explicit and enforced, and
  no production-unused error-reference helper remains.

### Item 11: Portable and secure generated projects

- [x] Portable emitted artifacts contain no host-specific absolute paths.
- [x] Ephemeral local dependency resolution is separated from distributable
  source and manifests.
- [x] Process invocation keeps executable/argument boundaries unless the user
  explicitly selected a shell API.
- [x] Allocation, path, and resource-limit conversions are checked.

### Item 11A: Generated-companion freshness and Item 11 integration

- [x] Start from reviewed Item 11 candidate
  `78c28c1e4c42bd85d685d3a3cffdf132fcdfcc40`; preserve its accepted
  portable-project, argument-boundary, and checked-conversion mechanisms.
- [x] Regenerate, through the candidate compiler rather than manual edits, the
  15 stale companions reported by the consumed Item 11 merge gate:
  `additional_modules`, `bisect`, `config_json_csv`, `container_methods`,
  `ergonomics`, `file_streams`, `glob`, `io`, `ordered_collections`, `stdlib`,
  `stdlib_ownership`, `structured_parsing_serialization`,
  `subscript_assignment`, `tempfiles_and_zip`, and `text_and_patterns`.
- [x] `python3 scripts/check_demo_emitted_freshness.py` passes on the exact
  Item 11A candidate, with no hand-edited generated output.
- [x] Close or supersede draft [#3687](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3687)
  only after the integrated candidate receives Item 11A's own exact-SHA agent
  review and sole merge-profile gate. Do not rerun Item 11's consumed gate.

### Item 12: Residual semantic completion and full-corpus qualification

- [ ] Every actionable inventory row is closed with merged evidence.
- [ ] All generated demos, verification fixtures, project modes, and benchmark
  representatives are regenerated by the final compiler.
- [ ] Full generated-code quality, e2e, stdlib, algorithmic, formatting,
  Clippy, file-size, HIR, create-PR, and merge gates pass as applicable on the
  exact final source SHA.
- [ ] The remaining `islice` parity form, generated-code debt, qualification
  profile composition, and cold/warm timing evidence have explicit passing
  coverage.
- [ ] Item 12 receives its normal exact-SHA implementation review; it does not
  consume the whole-phase review.

### 2026-09-05 orchestration amendment

The user approved fresh sequential workers for the Python dependencies, followed
by an integration worker, and authorized orchestration through phase closure.
Helmholtz is closed. Its candidates, review verdicts, and failed gates remain evidence.

- Execute 12G, 12H, 12I, and 12J in that order, with one live implementer.
  Each worker owns one isolated worktree and stops after merge or a concrete blocker.
- The [Python dependency issue](ad-hoc-python-interop-qualification-dependencies.md)
  defines their scope, dependencies, and named validation.
- Preserve Item 12B candidate `a3198ab9f936986b5ca1f9ce3fa73d36ac9ab74d`
  and corpus candidate `8bcbe7ab7939e5c8362c10f61a80e368022cc372`.
  Do not merge an unqualified dependency to bypass the other known failures.
- Item 12K receives one new integration review, at most one remediation review,
  and one exact-candidate merge-profile gate after dependency qualification.
  This is an explicit new integration allowance approved with the new work plan.
  It does not reopen Item 12B for a third review or relabel either failed gate.
- Integration review covers the new dependency changes and their interactions.
  Reuse the prior approved item evidence where implementation inputs are unchanged.
- If dependencies cannot merge independently because they share a failing gate,
  preserve their qualified candidates and record the dependency. The integration
  worker must establish passing evidence before any affected integration merge.
- After 12K, reconcile the recorded 12D, 12E, and 12F findings against merged
  evidence. Delegate unresolved work and remaining Item 12 scope sequentially.
  Do not treat a historical status row as proof that a finding is resolved.
- Assign the docs-only Item 12A closer only after every implementation item merges.
  Only that closer performs the whole-phase Opus review.
- Parent performs orchestration and record updates only, not implementation,
  tests, code review, or Sifr gates. User authorization covers the next phase actions.

### Item 12G closure: dependency-checker demo path identity

Closed on 2026-09-05 through [PR #3695](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3695).
Reviewed candidate: `1cb24bdd088bddf42077f6e42112e53bba7c3562`.
Merge SHA: `2b114727441f1adc3ed807adc0c41543ddab5b78`.
Base: `b475ebdcd37081aa2860d9c348ace4100b546eff`.

The checker selects `demos/python_dlpack` directly. Four focused regressions
cover computed paths for all audited projects, both authoritative input reads,
both missing inputs, and the obsolete concatenated-path mutation. Exact versions,
artifact hashes, package ownership, and missing-input errors remain enforced.

- All three commands registered before testing in the
  [owner issue](ad-hoc-python-interop-qualification-dependencies.md#item12g-implementation-and-focused-validation-plan)
  passed on the reviewed candidate: four focused unittests; the named
  `python_interop:dependency-versions` suite (one variant, zero failures,
  two projects, 19 packages, two locks, two images, seven negative mutations);
  and the canonical file-size guardrail (3,754 files).
- The [single exact-SHA Opus review and validation evidence](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3695#issuecomment-5554835685)
  returned **SATISFIED**, no blockers. No remediation review was needed.
  Raw evidence is under `/tmp/sifr-item12g.B8fCer/`, keyed by candidate SHA.
- Runner/test/docs-only changes triggered no Sifr gates under the explicit
  user rules. No Item12B review or failed gate was repeated.
- Non-blocking regression-discovery/import suggestions are separately owned
  by Python verification runner maintenance in the owner issue; no new mechanism
  defect was found. The review's pending status-record suggestion is resolved here.
- The isolated implementation branch is `codex/emitted-rust-excellence-item-12g`;
  the record-only branch is `codex/emitted-rust-excellence-item-12g-record`.
  Worktree: `/tmp/sifr-item12g.B8fCer/sifr`. Parent records were carried forward
  with main's naming findings preserved. Parent implementation, stash, and
  Helmholtz's retained candidate/index were not modified.
- Blocker: none. Item12G is complete. Stop this worker after the record update;
  the orchestrator may assign Item12H to a fresh worker. No next-item code was written.

<!-- Preserved dependency history; latest 12K dispatch is authoritative. -->

### Item 12H: Project-wide generated-field identity qualification

Item12H's isolated candidate is under qualification in
`/tmp/sifr-item12h.afJDbk/sifr`, branch
`codex/emitted-rust-excellence-item-12h`, from fresh main
`4ce05473f58716a611ac190581bf0737ba15331e`. It preserves Item12B and parent state.
The [Python owner issue](ad-hoc-python-interop-qualification-dependencies.md#item12h-project-wide-generated-field-identity-implementation)
records exact commands, mechanism regressions, the original native field failure
resolved by the candidate, and incomplete qualification. Inherited list-repeat
test failures and the Item12C builtin-registration Clippy failure require 12K
integration with preserved Item12B. A newly reached clean-environment bytecode
immutability failure belongs to Python build/verification and also blocks 12K.
No assertion, dependency, bytecode rule, or Item12I/12J mechanism was changed.

**Terminal handoff (2026-09-06): blocked, not merged.**

- Preserve [draft PR #3697](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3697), reviewed
  implementation `9b52ac20094608c8a31f252db99e49ef7c963384`. Merge SHA: none.
- The [initial review](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3697#issuecomment-5555203238)
  found late bridge generation outside the shared registry. The one remediation
  batch brings bridge declarations/consumers into the same pass, prevents module
  identity overwrite, includes bridge sources in cache identity, and removes
  independent per-file field canonicalization. The
  [remediation review](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3697#issuecomment-5555345800)
  is **SATISFIED**, no blocking findings. Two reviews used; no third review.
- Evidence: exact-SHA focused driver tests 3/3; final-source driver tests
  581 passed, 77 existing ignored; unchanged-codegen canonicalizer tests
  115 passed; rebuilt native binding case prints `binding runtime ok`.
  Formatting, HIR and file-size guardrails pass. All 264 demo companions pass
  freshness in the exact-SHA gate; 21 compiler-regenerated companions differ
  from base. No Sifr demo or reference Rust source changed.
- The one `scripts/run_all_tests.sh --profile merge` invocation on that clean
  SHA failed (exit 1, 362.20s) at coverage-matrix readiness: nine unclassified SQL
  packages, 13 unclassified targets, one stale PostgreSQL `lib` classification.
  Reached guardrails and Rust interop (10 variants, zero failures) passed.
  Later Python-area, crate, and E2E qualification was not reached. This is not
  a merge pass. No create-PR gate or second merge gate ran.
- [Exact-SHA validation and gate receipt](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3697#issuecomment-5555393502).
  Raw logs and copied JSON reports are preserved under `/tmp/sifr-item12h.afJDbk/`.
  The existing [SQL coverage registry owner](ad-hoc-schema-first-sql-platform-review-follow-ups.md#coverage-registry-blocker-observed-during-naming-cleanup-2026-09-05)
  records this reproduced failure. Its qualified repair is an additional 12K
  input alongside the already recorded Item12B/12C and Python build/verification
  dependencies. No SQL classification or gate requirement was weakened here.
- Field-resolution suggestions and pre-existing bridge-layout/API maintenance
  are recorded as unimplemented 12H-F1–F5 in the Python owner issue. The final
  review found no new blocking mechanism defect. Only record files change after
  the reviewed/gated SHA; no further tests, reviews or gates are required for
  this record update. Parent state and preserved Item12B/corpus candidates remain
  untouched. Stop this worker; no next item is started.

<!-- Preserved dependency history; latest 12K dispatch is authoritative. -->
### Item12J terminal handoff (2026-09-06)

Draft [PR #3699](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3699) preserves candidate
`f720a342edd87004975355b478948f7eb5c8b406`, based on freshly fetched main
`4ce05473f58716a611ac190581bf0737ba15331e`. **Not merged; not approved for
integration.** Owned branch `codex/emitted-rust-excellence-item-12j`, worktree
`/private/tmp/sifr-item12j.pT6Xkk/sifr`; parent records/index and retained
12B/12H/12I worktrees were not mutated.

- The ancestry repair preserves the original async fixtures and removes their
  source-check failures. Six focused regressions, IR (4), frontend (132 unit +
  7 integration), and driver (584 passed, 77 existing ignored) pass. All 264
  generated companions remain byte-identical; fmt, HIR and file-size guards pass.
- Both named native suites fail at 12I-owned cancellation task-local visibility
  E0425 after source checking; runtime assertions did not execute. Lowering
  retains two TypeVar assertion failures owned by #3667; codegen retains two
  12B-owned list-repeat failures; strict Clippy fails on the preserved12B/12C
  builtin-registration expect. None is a passing command or full certification.
- The [initial exact-SHA Opus review](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3699#issuecomment-5555927728)
  is **NOT SATISFIED**: 12J-R1, the newly accepted non-builtin error ancestry lacks
  generated `From<T> for Error` conversions. Opus reproduced E0277 for a local
  DomainError and imported CSV Error. This is an unresolved in-scope omission,
  not an external blocker to be waived. No remediation code was written.
- [Validation/terminal receipt and changed paths](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3699#issuecomment-5555929816)
  are keyed to the candidate outside the Git tree. Raw logs, JSON reports and
  review are retained in `/private/tmp/sifr-item12j.pT6Xkk/`.
- The user's orchestration checkpoint required terminal handoff once an external
  blocker was established. Stop after these records; remediation reviews used
  **0**, merge-profile gates **0**, create-PR gates **0**. There is no final
  reviewer-approved candidate to gate. No review/gate history is reset.
- The [Python owner record](ad-hoc-python-interop-qualification-dependencies.md#item12j-terminal-evidence-and-unresolved-review)
  owns12J-R1 and separate12J-F1–F3 follow-ups. A separately assigned continuation
  must resolve12J-R1 and preserve the remaining one-remediation/one-gate caps.
  12K integration and all next-item implementation remain unstarted by this worker.

### 2026-09-06 dependency handoff and bounded remediation

12G is merged (PRs #3695/#3696). 12H and 12I are approved but unmerged
candidates in draft PRs #3697/#3698; their sole gates failed externally owned
SQL coverage classifications. Their complete handoffs and deferred findings
remain in record commits `b6e6210a97598fb631b929b2d4daf4012b41bb16` and
`19ad69969a672d7b741122ded4dd879f2bdaf9ab`.

12J is unapproved, not merged: draft PR #3699, implementation
`f720a342edd87004975355b478948f7eb5c8b406`, record
`60219b080eadb519a813d9a84568552824be0754`. Its initial review found missing
non-builtin error conversions (12J-R1); native async validation also depends
on 12I. The original worker is closed. Assign a fresh worker to 12J-R1 before
12K. This is the remaining remediation of 12J, not a new initial-review cycle.

12J-R1 scope: connect semantic error ancestry to conversion demand for local,
project-imported and stdlib errors, preserving nominal identity and the original
runtime/error contract. Dependencies are the preserved 12J candidate and its
initial review; 12I remains a separate native qualification dependency.
Use the exact named validation in the Python owner issue at record `60219b0`,
including `cargo test -p sifr_driver async_python_error_channel` and the
`async-declaration-examples`/`async-context-examples` suites. Register focused
emission/compilation regressions before testing. Finish this in-scope correction
without absorbing known external failures. At most one remediation review and
one final-candidate merge gate remain for 12J; no third review or budget reset.
If external qualification still blocks merge, preserve the corrected reviewed
candidate for 12K. New second-review mechanism defects become later bounded
items. Do not integrate the unapproved 12J candidate as-is.

### Item12J-R1 terminal handoff (2026-09-06)

State: **blocked, NOT APPROVED, NOT MERGED**. Draft
[PR #3699](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3699) retains reviewed
implementation `4bc432f3474134b1a1d43202d39fd147893bb014`, following preserved
`f720a342` / record `60219b0` and remediation implementation `3ba19e49a`.
Owned worktree `/private/tmp/sifr-item12j-r1.9j9Uhf/sifr`, branch
`codex/emitted-rust-excellence-item-12j-r1`. The PR was updated by normal
fast-forward push; the original worker's rollback worktree and parent index/
intentional dirty documents remain unchanged. Base is still main
`4ce05473f58716a611ac190581bf0737ba15331e`.

- Final-candidate focused regressions: **9 pass**, including emission, native
  build and execution for local/transitive errors, project aliases/transitive
  errors/same-basename identities/builtin-name shadows, and distinct CSV and
  configparser Error classes. Full driver: **587 pass, 77 existing ignored**.
- All **264 companions are fresh**; only `demos/error_safety/emitted.rs` and
  `demos/stdlib/emitted.rs` were regenerated. Formatting, HIR and file-size
  checks pass (3758 files, 900-line cap). No original Sifr fixture, lockfile,
  workflow, runtime assertion, architecture or roadmap change was made.
- Codegen remains **1407 pass / 2 pre-existing 12B list-repeat failures**.
  Strict Clippy fails only at the unchanged 12B/12C-owned
  `project_stdlib_nominals.rs:45` expect. Unchanged original IR/frontend passes
  and #3667-owned lowering failures are reused with explicit input provenance.
- Both original named async suites fail native build at the **12I-owned
  cancellation task-local E0425** (HTTP one Rust error; context 58, with retained
  E0425 stderr tail). Neither runtime marker was observed; cleanup/cancellation
  runtime preservation remains unqualified. No external repair was absorbed.
- The [sole remediation Opus review](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3699#issuecomment-5556273003)
  returned **NOT SATISFIED**. New mechanism: broad nominal demand emits
  `Self::new(err.message)` even for errors without a string message, including
  errors never converted to the root Error. The reviewer verified a previously
  compiling `CodeError(Error)` with only `code: int` now fails E0609 merely when
  an unrelated function mentions Error. Empty errors and `message: int` also
  fail. Accepted message-less root upcasts remain uncompilable (E0277 before R1,
  E0609 now), so the original conversion obligation also remains unresolved.
- This is later bounded **Item12J-M1**, owned by nominal error representation
  and conversion-demand/ancestry admissibility. The
  [Python owner record](ad-hoc-python-interop-qualification-dependencies.md#later-item12j-m1-error-message-storage-and-root-upcast-admissibility)
  records its scope and the required adjudication. No later-item code was
  written. The review's mapping-cleanup suggestion is separate 12J-F5.
- Cumulative Item12J budget: **one initial review + one remediation review used;
  both NOT SATISFIED. Zero create-PR gates, zero merge-profile gates, no merge.**
  The user's second-review stop rule prevents another fix/review cycle. The
  unused gate was not run without an approved candidate. Do not integrate this
  candidate as-is or reset any original review/gate history.

Exact evidence is preserved outside the reviewed Git tree at
`/private/tmp/sifr-item12j-r1.9j9Uhf/evidence-4bc432f3474134b1a1d43202d39fd147893bb014.md`,
with SHA-keyed review and native JSON reports. The compiler hash is
`12adc00c7d5111550f893a20b1b3c3936ece888a13e3bf14b22e67f2d4e7fe09`.
The final handoff is documentation-only and receives no extra review or gate.
Next action: adjudicate 12J-M1 and the unresolved conversion obligation before
any 12J qualification/integration; this worker stops after publishing records.
### Item12K receipt and B5 dispatch (2026-09-06)

Kierkegaard is closed after the [terminal handoff](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3717#issuecomment-5560373170).
Preserved clone `/private/tmp/sifr-item12k-final.7sgsI9/sifr`, candidate
`286067170ee7c4edfb61cd37afece30519b4c1c5`, record
`9f8dbec61c4416d5d002a1a9c90913c00a06fe9a`, base/main
`f11e1cd7eef16a02063555bccc9fd8e19287833b`, corpus
`8bcbe7ab7939e5c8362c10f61a80e368022cc372` (PR48), no merge.
Original12K still has zero reviews, remediation reviews, provider requests and gates.
Fresh native90, algorithmic411, diagnostics184, readiness4, frontend139, IR4,
types147, required-message5 and async9 pass. The full driver run failed594/1
with77 existing ignored; the structural metadata assertion correction passes
its focused test, but does not turn that failed full invocation into a pass.
Authenticated codegen1452, lowering1119, Python30, demo264 and B2/B3/B4 focused
evidence remains available. Full E2E, migrated stdlib and ignored-driver build
lanes remain unrun. Strict Clippy found the two external failures below.

Next item is **12K-B5 / [#3716](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3716)**,
owner compiler-driver portable generated projects. Dependencies are the complete
retained12K context above; narrow B5 approval must not approve inherited12K code.
Scope: correct `obfuscated_if_else` in `portable_dependency_line` and
`type_complexity` in `authority_packages`, without suppression, fallback,
manifest-output changes, lock-source changes or unrelated repair. These two
files are unchanged from main; the owner issue contains exact blob provenance.

Use a fresh owned clone/branch retaining the complete12K record and exact corpus;
do not mutate any previous checkout, target, index or the parent's dirty records.
Register this dispatch in the owned phase before implementation. Named tests:
`cargo test -p sifr_driver`, `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings`,
`cargo fmt --check`, `python3 scripts/check_hir_maintainability_guardrails.py`,
`python3 scripts/check_file_size_guardrails.py`, and `git diff --check`.
The worker may register exact focused semantic-regression commands before testing
if needed for these two changes. Complete the entire bounded correction before
tests. Preserve/reuse authenticated unaffected evidence rather than rerunning the
90/411/184/Python matrices reflexively. All canonical JSON reports belong inside
the owned repository; preserve actual pass/fail/unrun distinctions.

B5 receives the normal one exact-SHA initial Opus review and at most one
remediation review, scoped to B5's exact delta. Compiler paths change, so one
merge-profile gate on the final approved candidate is required; skip create-pr
for intended in-session delivery. No second gate and no predecessor budget reset.
Prefer the already-qualified integration context over deliberately reproducing
known main-only SQL/Python prerequisite gaps. A passing exact-SHA gate receipt
must be preserved for later integration evidence reuse under the user's rule;
it does not itself provide the still-required broad12K integration review.
Do not merge inherited unreviewed implementation under narrow B5 approval.
If independent safe delivery is impossible, return the approved stacked candidate
and gate evidence as integration-delivery-pending, not as a newly discovered
mechanism blocker. A genuine new external failure or second-review mechanism
gets a later owner and terminal handoff. Do not implement12K/12D/E/F/Item12/12A
or run whole-phase review. Return exact base/candidate/record/merge SHAs, PR,
changed paths, evidence, all consumed counts and the precise next action.

#### B5 owned execution registration (2026-09-06)

Owned clone: `/private/tmp/sifr-item12k-b5.5WJpGX/sifr`; branch
`codex/item12k-b5-portable-clippy`. The sole implementer preserves exact review
base/integration record `9f8dbec61c4416d5d002a1a9c90913c00a06fe9a`, including
all normal ancestry and corpus `8bcbe7ab7939e5c8362c10f61a80e368022cc372`.
Fetched main remains `f11e1cd7eef16a02063555bccc9fd8e19287833b`, already an
ancestor. Parent/predecessor checkouts, indexes, records and targets are read-only.

Implementation is restricted to an explicit package-alias `if/else` in
`portable_dependency_line` and a private named authoritative-checksum map type
for `authority_packages`. Existing manifest-output and lock-source regression
tests run through the registered full `cargo test -p sifr_driver`; no additional
focused invocation is registered. All six named checks above run after the
complete bounded code batch. The inherited metadata assertion fix is retained.

B5 allowances: one initial exact-SHA read-only Opus review, at most one
remediation review, one governed merge-profile gate on the approved candidate,
zero create-pr gates. Initial provider-request failure permits at most two
request retries with fresh atomic-output directories under the requested skill.
The review is only the B5 delta from the exact integration record; inherited12K
implementation is explicitly unreviewed. No inherited budget is reset; original12K
counts remain zero. Safe independent delivery must not merge that unreviewed
stack. If that delivery boundary remains, retain the narrow approved candidate
and actual gate receipt as `integration-delivery-pending` for a fresh original12K
worker; do not perform the broader review here.

### Item12K-B5 receipt and B6 dispatch (2026-09-06)

Jason is closed after the [B5 terminal receipt](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3719#issuecomment-5560531600).
Candidate `d4d7eb5cc80e6e4e623e3b5d343702e5055f8946`, record
`9a42fe4239426cb53438b1d8f6a000f4c0a352d5` in
`/private/tmp/sifr-item12k-b5.5WJpGX/sifr` preserve B5's two source corrections
and records only. Review base is `9f8dbec61c4416d5d002a1a9c90913c00a06fe9a`.
Main/corpus remain f11e1cd/8bcbe7a as above. Nothing merged. B5 and original12K
both retain zero initial/remediation reviews, provider requests and gates.
Full driver invocation failed during rustdoc after595 unit passes/77ignored;
four static checks passed; Clippy was not reached. The E0463 cause is unproven,
not an established portable-project regression. Preserve the failed invocation.

Next bounded owner is **12K-B6 / [#3718](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3718)**,
compiler validation / driver Cargo-rustdoc integration. Depends on the retained
B5 context above. Diagnose and resolve/adjudicate the12 dependency-resolution
errors from `Doc-tests sifr_driver`; establish the actual toolchain/artifact/
environment or repository cause with evidence. Missing `.rlib` paths and a
simple rustc/rustdoc version mismatch were not established: sampled files exist
and both tools report1.98.0(88d9e12ae). The failure log and wrapper are in the
owner issue; no assumption that the narrow B5 transformations caused it.

Use a fresh owned clone/branch/temp/target with retained ancestry, exact corpus,
and latestmain assessment. Old checkouts/targets/indexes remain read-only.
Read logs, wrappers, relevant configuration and dependency provenance before
deciding whether a repository patch is warranted. Register specific diagnostic
commands before execution; safe read-only artifact/toolchain checks are in scope.
Named qualification: `cargo test -p sifr_driver --doc` for focused reproduction
and correction, then `cargo test -p sifr_driver` for one actually passing full
invocation on corrected final inputs; `cargo fmt --check`, HIR/file-size guards
and `git diff --check` for touched material. Preserve595 unit successes without
calling the preceding full command a pass. Do not disable doctests, ignore
failures, weaken checks, add fallback resolution, blindly downgrade toolchains,
or repeat broad matrices. A transient/environment conclusion requires concrete
evidence and genuine passing qualification, not merely an assumed stale cache.

Implement the complete bounded correction before final tests if a real patch is
needed. If no repository correction is justified, record the evidence-backed
environment adjudication as documentation only. One exact-SHA B6 Opus review,
maxone remediation; no whole-phase review or B5/12K review. If B6 compiler,
lockfile,fixture,workflow changes, use one approved-SHA merge gate, no second,
skip create-pr for intended delivery. Otherwise do not run Sifr gates. Preserve
exact passing evidence for later reuse. Narrow approval cannot authorize merging
unreviewed inherited code; an approved stacked delivery may return to original
B5 then12K. Do not create a new mechanism item solely for that delivery dependency.
True unrelated blockers/new second-review mechanisms get their own later owner.
Stop at terminal handoff, no B5 completion or other item implementation here.

#### B6 owned execution and registered diagnostics

Sole implementer owns `/private/tmp/sifr-item12k-b6.YxonRW/sifr`, branch
`codex/item12k-b6-rustdoc`, its index, target and sibling temporary/evidence paths.
Parent and all predecessor checkout/index/target paths remain read-only.
The complete B5 record is the B6 base; its inherited implementation is outside
the narrow B6 review and cannot merge under that approval.

Registered before diagnostic execution:
- Authenticate the supplied driver log and provenance SHA256 receipts; inspect
  `qualify.sh`, error arguments and all 16 exact submodule identities.
- Inspect `rust-toolchain.toml`, Cargo manifests/configs (repository and ancestor
  `.cargo/config{,.toml}` and Cargo home config), selected non-secret Rust/Cargo/
  build environment, `command -v`, `rustup which/show`, and verbose tool versions.
- Inspect B5 target `.rustc_info.json`, `.fingerprint` JSON, dep-info and rlib
  metadata/digests with `stat`, `file`, `ar`, `shasum`, and loader diagnostics.
  Any direct compiler/rustdoc probe writes only to owned temporary outputs;
  predecessor artifacts are read-only inputs. Register adaptive probes here.
- Assess `origin/main` and retained ancestry; clone all 16 submodules locally
  without hardlinks or shared indexes and verify exact gitlinks.
- Reproduce with `cargo test -p sifr_driver --doc -vv` in the fresh owned target,
  capture effective rustdoc arguments, then qualify corrected final inputs with
  `cargo test -p sifr_driver`. Keep `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=6`, `RUST_TEST_THREADS=1`,
  and owned `TMPDIR`, `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`, UV/Python cache directories.
- Run named fmt, HIR/file-size guards and `git diff --check`; no broad matrices,
  Clippy/B5 qualification, or gate absent governed B6 changes.
- Adaptive artifact probe: a minimal owned Rust file importing `ruff_text_size`
  is loaded by the pinned `rustc --emit=metadata` and `rustdoc --test`, comparing
  the identical retained `.rlib` and sibling `.rmeta`. Run with Cargo's package
  environment restored for full rustdoc replay; no prior output is overwritten.
- Adaptive provenance discrimination: resolve the retained minimal import and
  full driver rustdoc against the freshly built owned dependency search path
  as well as the retained read-only paths. Compare registry/vendor `rustversion`
  dep-info, fingerprint source identities and crate hashes. This is a diagnostic
  comparison only, not a product fallback or the final qualification command.
- Correction under investigation: do not export the outer `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`
  to driver tests. Cargo uses this owned clone's default `target`; nested Rust
  probes then use their existing owned-TMPDIR probe cache. Qualify using the
  unchanged named focused doc/full commands, with no source changes if proved.
- Controlled mechanism experiment: in a separate owned scratch target, build a
  tiny Rust library using the pinned `rustversion=1.0.22` proc macro from the
  registry. Test its import with direct rustdoc before and after a second Cargo
  project checks the same dependency using this clone's vendor source into that
  scratch target. Record the exact commands, dylib hashes, dep-info, and loader
  diagnostics. This isolates source-replacement target collision without running
  another full driver invocation or mutating qualified/retained targets.

#### B6 artifact/environment adjudication

The observed E0463 is a transitive `rustversion` crate-hash mismatch caused by
sharing the outer compiler target with nested Cargo builds that replace registry
sources with the sysroot vendor source. B5's exported `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` applied
to both graphs. The existing Rust-probe target contract explicitly honors that
override (`rust_interop_probe_paths.rs`); without it, probes use their separate
`rust_bridge_probe_target` below the generated artifact cache in `TMPDIR`.

Concrete evidence in `/private/tmp/sifr-item12k-b6.YxonRW/evidence/`:
- The supplied B5 driver log and complete provenance JSON match their dispatch
  SHA256 values. Latest main is still `f11e1cd7eef16a02063555bccc9fd8e19287833b`,
  in retained ancestry. All 16 submodules match the retained gitlinks.
- B5's `castaway` metadata requests `rustversion` hash
  `5b8d38d007006937f6b5c3db60cc9286`; the same-named
  `librustversion-3c65caf96f152204.dylib` instead exposes
  `d6dc5f697ffa42aabc7ce7174d88b1f7`. Its dep-info names the B5 vendor tree,
  whereas the fresh matching Cargo artifact name names the Cargo registry.
  Both `.rlib` and `.rmeta` imports fail for that missing transitive identity.
  See `minimal-rustc-rlib.log` and the minimal rustdoc logs.
- Restoring Cargo package environment preserves all 12 original errors
  (`old-cargo-env.log`). Adding a fresh clone's dependency search path does not
  repair the old artifacts: that build has its own crate identities. No mixed
  artifact path is used for qualification.
- A controlled scratch experiment builds a two-line library using exactly
  `rustversion=1.0.22`. Its direct rustdoc import passes. A second Cargo project
  checking the same dependency with vendor source replacement in the same
  scratch target replaces the proc-macro artifact; the identical import then
  fails E0463 for `rustversion`. See `collision-{before,after}.log`, build/check
  logs and `target/verification/areas/item12k-b6-collision-{before,after}.json`.
  The experiment does not mutate the qualification target or any retained target.
- Fresh `cargo test -p sifr_driver --doc -vv` passes on the unchanged retained
  source, before any driver test execution. It fully loads/types the driver
  documentation target and reports zero doctest examples, not disabled coverage.

The bounded correction is invocation-level target isolation: unset
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR` in the B6 qualification environment and use Cargo's default
`target` in this fresh owned clone. Keep `TMPDIR`, UV cache and Python cache
owned; keep `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=6` and `RUST_TEST_THREADS=1`. Nested probes select
their existing separate TMPDIR cache. No source, lockfile, fixture, workflow,
toolchain, coverage setting or fallback changes are warranted for this receipt.
The canonical commands are `cargo test -p sifr_driver --doc`, followed by one
`cargo test -p sifr_driver` on the corrected inputs, then the four named static
checks. Their exact-SHA receipts must pass before B6 review/approval; logs are
outside Git and canonical JSON reports are inside this owned repository's target.
This cold build is not host-sensitive performance evidence.

B5's original invocation remains failed after 595 unit successes/77 ignored;
its Clippy, review and gate remain unreached. Broad retained matrices are not
rerun by B6. B6's documentation-only adjudication consumes no Sifr profile gate.
One narrow exact-SHA review can approve only this adjudication. Delivery remains
stacked pending original B5/12K integration; no inherited code merges under it.

#### B6 terminal receipt (2026-09-06)

State: **environment adjudication qualified and approved; stacked integration
delivery pending**. [PR #3720](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3720)
targets the retained B5 branch. This is the explicitly authorized B6 terminal
delivery condition, not a new mechanism blocker. Merge SHA: **none**.

- Exact reviewed/qualified B6 candidate:
  `4d076ebe08f00ba7ff6ea6ae7f910397ba7b2356`.
- Exact B6 base/B5 record: `9a42fe4239426cb53438b1d8f6a000f4c0a352d5`;
  B5 source: `d4d7eb5cc80e6e4e623e3b5d343702e5055f8946`;
  inherited B5 review base: `9f8dbec61c4416d5d002a1a9c90913c00a06fe9a`.
- Main reverified unchanged: `f11e1cd7eef16a02063555bccc9fd8e19287833b`.
  Corpus unchanged: `8bcbe7ab7939e5c8362c10f61a80e368022cc372`.
  The phase-only terminal record is a later commit identified in the PR receipt;
  it does not replace the reviewed candidate or alter its validation inputs.
- Complete corrected `cargo test -p sifr_driver` **PASS exit 0**,
  2026-09-06 16:31:20–16:43:29 UTC, 728.46 seconds: **595 unit passes,
  0 failures, 77 normally ignored**, then successful driver doctests (zero
  examples, full library rustdoc loading/type checking). Corrected focused
  `cargo test -p sifr_driver --doc` also passes on the exact candidate.
- `cargo fmt --check`, HIR maintainability, file-size guard (3780 files/900
  lines), and `git diff --check` all pass. The exact committed diff check passes.
  No create-pr or merge-profile gate: B6 changes only this Markdown file.
- The early-unit-run and post-full-run artifact captures are byte-identical,
  including timestamps: the outer registry proc macro and retained B5 artifacts
  were preserved. Registry/vendor `rustversion` Rust sources are identical across
  all 24 files. Final own target: 4.2 GiB, 109 GiB free; no cleanup performed.
- The [initial Opus review](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3720#issuecomment-5560686820)
  returned **SATISFIED**, no blockers. It independently authenticated the 34-entry
  final evidence inventory and checked the mechanism and exact-SHA full pass.
  Its approval applies only to B6; B5/original 12K reviews remain unperformed.
- Consumed B6 counts: **1 initial review, 0 remediation reviews, 1 provider
  request, 0 retries, 0 create-pr gates, 0 merge gates, 0 merges**. Diagnostic
  work includes one initial fresh focused Cargo doc run, one corrected focused
  doc run, and one corrected full-driver invocation; direct loader/scratch
  experiments are separately recorded. B5 and original 12K still each retain
  **0 reviews/0 provider requests/0 gates**, with all historical budgets intact.

Content-addressed receipts (root `/private/tmp/sifr-item12k-b6.YxonRW/`):

Deferred nonblocking review follow-ups, separate from B6 completion:
- **B6-F1 / records owner:** normalize missing spaces in copied historical
  dispatch text when that record is next maintained. The dispatch was copied
  verbatim; its content is accurate. No typography sweep started here.
- **B6-F2 / diagnostic evidence owner:** use distinct names for the before-state
  command receipt and artifact map in future scratch experiments. The artifact
  map occupied `item12k-b6-collision-before.json`; the passing before-state log
  and its inventory hash remain available, but there is no separate command JSON
  for that leg. Opus classified this as nonblocking infrastructure asymmetry.
  No evidence was reconstructed as if it were an original invocation receipt.

No technical blocker remains for B6. Exact next action: hand this approved
stacked candidate and documentation record back to the original B5/12K owners.
They must preserve the corrected invocation isolation and authenticate/reuse
applicable evidence, then complete their own remaining qualification, review,
gate and integration delivery. B5's previous full invocation stays failed and
its Clippy remains unrun; B6's successful full invocation is a separate receipt.
Full E2E, migrated stdlib and normally ignored driver lanes are not certified
by this standalone item. No B5 completion, broad integration review, merge of
inherited unreviewed code, next-item implementation or new gate was performed.

### Item 12B: Bounded algorithmic dependency repair

On 2026-09-05, the user authorized the same worker to repair both repositories.

- Scope: repair external conversion and index-error source contracts, plus the
  compiler ownership mechanisms required to compile and execute those fixtures.
- Compiler scope includes loop sentinel reuse, repeat-count reuse, directly
  necessary same-mechanism corrections, and focused regression coverage.
- External source changes preserve every original case and algorithm behavior.
- The item includes the external PR/merge and the Sifr compiler/gitlink PR/merge.
- Earlier restrictions against these compiler changes are superseded.
  Unrelated Item 12 generated-quality work remains separate.
- Implementation starts from Sifr base
  `2dc4165fd9e7c34432a9b0d098188dc645aaca55` on the isolated Item 12B branch.
  Any prerequisite from retained Item 12 work requires explicit path-level provenance.
- External checkpoint `f6db5bd5d363b19a3040afd2a092f44ce32fd5bb`,
  Sifr handoff `1efb8720fa827f3bf19de17c7f010e3009f0e484`, and retained
  compiler candidate `8ad089a9458f35fcfa228e93fe44f4d69731828b` remain preserved.
- Qualification uses a newly built compiler from the isolated candidate.
  The retained frozen compiler is historical diagnostic evidence only.
- Review: one exact-SHA Opus review identifies both repository candidates.
  At most one remediation review is permitted. No whole-phase review is permitted.
- Gate: one merge-profile gate covers the exact final Sifr candidate.
  Skip create-PR. Do not repeat the merge gate.
- Close Item 12B and update its records, then stop. Do not start Item 12 or 12A.


<!-- Historical incoming Item12B record; later 12K dispatch is authoritative. -->
#### Item 12B qualified implementation (before review and merge)

State: implementation qualification passed; Item 12B remains open until review and merge.

- Compiler source: `8c5bfefb32ccefbd8d925c14c554d3be1eb361d2`.
- Compiler SHA-256: `d47774bba160db3903b9143071352af3b3001d6ec16173731cad5811b4b7abad`.
- External corpus candidate: `da4a0e8680c6b50c5544d77bfb92e9e4cddf1ab1`.
- `native-qualified/matrix.json`: 90/90 repaired fixtures pass both check and native execution.
  This includes median, zigzag, browser history, all original assertions, and the added ownership cases.
- `borrow-final-codegen.log`: 1,435/1,435 codegen tests pass, including all 26 focused corpus-repair regressions.
- `borrow-final-focused.log`: the exact borrowed-parameter regression command selects and passes one test.
- `borrow-final-clippy.log`, `borrow-final-fmt.log`, `borrow-final-size.log`, and `borrow-final-hir.log`: pass.
- `borrow-final-demo-regeneration.log`: all 264 generated companions are fresh.
- Evidence files above are under `/tmp/sifr-item12b.akguMz/`.
- No Opus review or merge-profile gate has run yet. The create-PR gate remains skipped.

The canonical `leetcode-full` command passes 411/411 cases with zero failures.
Its immutable evidence is `leetcode-full-7f393-results.json` and `leetcode-full-final.log`.
That run used compiler source `7f3930ab4b05cd5ab50edb897be6a56329ab43f6`, digest
`68fbec4c7d99c843f0f75135e7c41b06d1552a0a769676f6df39982c6dc257f8`, and the same external corpus candidate.

This front-end evidence is reused by input identity, not relabeled as a later-SHA run.
The only subsequent compiler change is the nested arithmetic emitter's borrowed-operand adapter.
The CLI check path calls `check_project` or `check_single_file`, then returns front-end diagnostics without Rust emission.
The CLI source, driver, frontend/lowering/type-system/IR sources, stdlib, Cargo inputs, corpus, and algorithmic runner are unchanged.
Main's intervening changes rename demo variables and a regex test; they do not change those inputs.
Native qualification was rerun in full with the corrected compiler.
The retained Item 12 compiler candidate is not used as qualification evidence.

#### Item 12B continuation amendment: naming and SQL coverage dependency

On 2026-09-05 the user explicitly authorized both remaining repairs and **one
replacement merge-profile gate**. This supersedes the prior stop below, not its
failed evidence. The first gate on `6ce83824e0315e5f89383fc666344b99431e1e76`
remains failed. No create-PR gate is permitted.

- Replace all 428 corpus taxonomy occurrences with descriptive, collision-free
  semantic local names. Preserve assertions, typed receiving contracts, scope,
  call order, and evaluation count.
- Reconcile authoritative Cargo coverage classifications with the actual SQL
  packages, target kinds, and test targets (23 recorded diagnostics), coordinating
  through `ad-hoc-schema-first-sql-platform-review-follow-ups.md`.
  Do not alter package semantics, weaken checkers, exclude targets, suppress
  diagnostics, or rebase accepted debt.
- Keep the reviewed candidates and record checkpoints in history.
- Use the one remaining exact-SHA Opus remediation review for both corrected
  repository candidates and this SQL metadata dependency. No third review.
- After satisfactory review run exactly one replacement merge gate on the final
  candidate, then merge both PRs and update records. Do not start Item 12 or 12A.

Additional/affected named validation, fixed before execution:

```bash

```

Coverage readiness includes new negative cases `wrong_component_target_kind`
(both missing rlib and stale lib findings) and `missing_sql_test_target`.
The canonical readiness suite executes all four listed coverage scripts, so those
checks need not be repeated as standalone commands. Use its uv environment.
MySQL and SQLite compiler crates now join the ordinary profile crate-test
membership, matching PostgreSQL; this executes their existing tests rather than
misclassifying compiler packages to evade required membership.

The native helper will run check AND native execution for all 90 repaired fixtures
with the identified compiler (exact helper invocation recorded before execution).
The rename proof compares token streams against corpus `da4a0e8680c6b50c5544d77bfb92e9e4cddf1ab1`,
allowing only an injective local identifier mapping; string literals, assertions,
types, and all other tokens must remain identical.
Compiler-source/binary, codegen regression, and crate Clippy evidence may be
reused only if their inputs remain unchanged, with original SHA attribution.
Fresh full-corpus evidence will use the corrected corpus pin.
#### Item 12B terminal checkpoint: remediation approved; replacement gate blocked

State on 2026-09-05: **not merged, not closed**. This supersedes earlier
authentication, corpus-naming, SQL-classification, and gate-authorization stops.

The user authorized the 428 corpus naming corrections, the 23 SQL coverage
classification corrections, and one replacement merge gate. Those repairs are
implemented, pushed, and approved; neither checker requirements nor safety were weakened.

| binding-authoring | Imported PythonError field initializer disagrees with its declaration, Rust E0560 (later Item12H). |
| callback-examples | Three async examples cannot access the support-owned cancellation task-local, Rust E0425 (later Item12I). |

| async-context-examples | Same error-channel failure as Item12J. |

The warm wall-time budget was also exceeded (advisory); no host-sensitive
performance pass is claimed. Later profile stages were not reached.
The first gate at `6ce83824e` remains failed; the replacement is also failed.
No create-PR gate, third gate, third review, or merge occurred. Both PRs remain draft.
These Python dependencies are recorded in
`ad-hoc-python-interop-qualification-dependencies.md`; no repair was started.

Evidence root: `/tmp/sifr-item12b.akguMz/`.
Current qualification: `native-naming-qualified/matrix.json`,
`leetcode-full-naming-results.json`, `leetcode-full-naming.log`,
`coverage-remediation-results.json`, `coverage-remediation.log`,
`semantic-renames-proof.json`, and `naming-final-*.log`.
Replacement gate: `merge-replacement-a3198ab9f936986b5ca1f9ce3fa73d36ac9ab74d.log`,
`replacement-a319-lane-report.json`, `replacement-a319-python-results.json`,
`replacement-a319-coverage-results.json`, and
`replacement-a319-{callback,async-declaration,async-context}-examples.json`.
[Published qualification](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3694#issuecomment-5554449846)
preserves the complete/partial distinctions.

Exact next action: resolve/adjudicate the four separately recorded Python
dependencies and the exhausted review/gate limits before resuming closure.
Current continuation authority does not permit a third review or another gate.
Preserve these candidates and the record-only checkpoint commits; do not merge
without required qualification. Retained Item12 implementation
`8ad089a9458f35fcfa228e93fe44f4d69731828b` is unchanged. Do not start Item12/12A.

#### Deferred remediation-review suggestions

- Later Item12F (not started): rename the 16 pre-existing
  `updated_contract_value_*` locals in corpus `0202_happy_number.sifr` and
  `0212_word_search_ii.sifr`. Opus classified this as a non-blocking naming
  follow-up outside the enumerated 428-occurrence remediation, not a new
  mechanism defect. No checker weakening or third review was used.
- The SQL issue retains the non-blocking suggestion to confirm whether
  `sqlite-runtime-probe` should remain SQLite-only. Its current classification
  is accurate; no missing MySQL/PostgreSQL implementation is claimed.
- Earlier Item12 clone/receiver suggestions and unconfirmed Item12E integer
  field augmented-assignment qualification remain deferred.

#### Item 12B terminal checkpoint: review approved; merge gate blocked

State on 2026-09-05: **not merged and not closed**. This checkpoint supersedes
the historical authentication and scope-adjudication stops below.

- Reviewed Sifr candidate: `6ce83824e0315e5f89383fc666344b99431e1e76`,

  [PR #48](https://github.com/sifr-lang/leetcode/pull/48).
- The resumed initial Opus review returned **SATISFIED**, with no blocking findings.
  [Sifr review](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3694#issuecomment-5554250479)
  and [corpus review](https://github.com/sifr-lang/leetcode/pull/48#issuecomment-5554250666).
  Earlier OAuth failures were not review verdicts. One successful initial review
  is consumed; no remediation review has run.
- Review artifact, outside Git:
  `/tmp/sifr-item12b.akguMz/opus-6ce83824e0315e5f89383fc666344b99431e1e76.UxSZXC/response.md`.
- Passing implementation evidence remains unchanged: 90/90 repaired fixtures pass
  check and native execution with compiler source `8c5bfefb32ccefbd8d925c14c554d3be1eb361d2`,
  digest `d47774bba160db3903b9143071352af3b3001d6ec16173731cad5811b4b7abad`;
  1,435 codegen tests (all 26 focused regressions), strict codegen Clippy, fmt,
  file-size/HIR checks, and 264-companion freshness pass.
  The 411/411 canonical check result remains explicitly attributed to
  `7f3930ab4b05cd5ab50edb897be6a56329ab43f6` and reused only by unchanged
  frontend/corpus input identity. No tests were repeated merely for this resumption.

The **one** merge-profile gate ran on exact Sifr candidate `6ce83824e0315e5f89383fc666344b99431e1e76`:

```bash
SIFR_SYSROOT=/tmp/sifr-item12b.akguMz/sifr scripts/run_all_tests.sh --profile merge
```

It exited 1 after 173.63 seconds. All preceding reached steps passed, including
264-companion freshness and Rust interop. Coverage readiness had two failing variants:

1. **Pre-existing external blocker:** 23 SQL package/target classification diagnostics
   (nine missing package classifications, missing targets, and stale PostgreSQL
   `lib` versus `rlib`). The candidate changes no SQL Cargo or coverage-registry
   inputs. Owner: `ad-hoc-schema-first-sql-platform-review-follow-ups.md`.
2. **In-scope omission:** 428 verification-taxonomy diagnostics on newly introduced
   corpus `contract_result_*` locals. These are Item 12B fixture naming failures,
   not SQL failures and not waived by the passing semantic tests or Opus review.
   Example: `src/1396_design_underground_system.sifr:54`.
   Repair requires descriptive semantic names, preserving every assertion,
   typed receiving contract, and evaluation order; do not weaken the checker.

Immutable gate evidence under `/tmp/sifr-item12b.akguMz/`:
`merge-6ce83824e0315e5f89383fc666344b99431e1e76.log`,
`merge-6ce83824e-coverage-results.json`, and
`merge-6ce83824e-lane-report.json`.
No create-PR gate, duplicate merge gate, or merge occurred. Both PRs remain draft.
Later checkpoint commits update records only; they do not turn the failed gate
into a pass or transfer review approval to changed implementation.

Exact next action: resolve the separately owned SQL coverage blocker and adjudicate
the conflict between the exhausted single-gate budget and exact-final-SHA qualification
after the required corpus naming correction. Then correct the in-scope names,
refresh the corpus pin and affected named evidence, and use at most the one remaining
remediation review. A replacement gate needs an explicit exception to the no-second-gate
rule; no such exception is inferred from routine continuation authority.
The isolated worktree and both candidates remain preserved. Retained Item 12
compiler `8ad089a9458f35fcfa228e93fe44f4d69731828b` remains separate.
Do not start Item 12 or 12A.

#### Deferred review findings (not Item 12B implementation)

- Existing Item 12 owns the correctness-motivated clone residue and consistency of
  explicit imported mutable receiver borrowing. The review identified these as suggestions,
  not new Item 12B acceptance criteria.
- **Later Item 12E: integer field augmented-assignment qualification.** Not started.
  Confirm the frontend/lowering contract for integer field `/=` and `%=`, both
  outside and inside try closures. Opus noted the pre-existing gap at
  `crates/sifr_codegen/src/stmt_support_emitter/stmt_block_helpers.rs:495`:
  the simple path admits these operators while `SifrInt` has no corresponding
  assignment traits. This is an unconfirmed follow-up, not a reproduced Item 12B
  failure. Any repair and tests require its own bounded item; no code was added here.

#### Item 12B terminal checkpoint: external review authentication blocker

State: blocked before review and merge; Item 12B is not closed.
This checkpoint supersedes earlier scope-adjudication stops. Builtin registration and the recorded native-execution dependencies are authorized and implemented inside Item 12B.

- Qualified Sifr candidate: `4096a2e93b5fec3725c56c0a940dde995069d1f5`.
  Compiler implementation: `8c5bfefb32ccefbd8d925c14c554d3be1eb361d2`.
  Later checkpoint commits change records only.
- [Sifr PR #3694](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3694), branch `codex/emitted-rust-excellence-item-12b`, remains draft.
- [Corpus PR #48](https://github.com/sifr-lang/leetcode/pull/48), branch `codex/item12b-source-contracts`, remains draft at `da4a0e8680c6b50c5544d77bfb92e9e4cddf1ab1`.
- Complete current qualification: 90/90 repaired fixtures pass check and native execution; all original cases remain.
  Codegen tests pass 1,435/1,435, including all 26 focused regressions.
  Strict codegen Clippy, fmt, file-size/HIR guardrails, and 264-companion freshness pass.
- Canonical `leetcode-full` passes 411/411 checks at `7f3930ab4b05cd5ab50edb897be6a56329ab43f6`.
  Its unchanged front-end/corpus inputs support explicit reuse; it is not relabeled as a later-SHA run.
  Native qualification was repeated with the corrected compiler.
- Corrected compiler SHA-256: `d47774bba160db3903b9143071352af3b3001d6ec16173731cad5811b4b7abad`.
- Evidence root: `/tmp/sifr-item12b.akguMz/`.
  Use `native-qualified/matrix.json`, `leetcode-full-7f393-results.json`, `leetcode-full-final.log`, and `borrow-final-*.log`.
- The retained Item 12 candidate `8ad089a9458f35fcfa228e93fe44f4d69731828b` remains separate and unchanged.
  No remaining Item 12 or Item 12A implementation was started.

The initial Opus request and both permitted request retries failed without a verdict.
Retained logs report: `Failed to authenticate: OAuth session expired and could not be refreshed`.
The official subscription sign-in was attempted. Interactive authentication could not complete with the available browser access.
The pending login process was cancelled; no account, billing mode, or security setting was changed.
No review approval, remediation review, create-PR gate, merge-profile gate, or merge has occurred.
The known SQL coverage issue remains separately owned; no new gate result is claimed.

The request logs remain outside Git in:
`opus-4096a2e93b5fec3725c56c0a940dde995069d1f5.zO2RVq/claude.log`,
`opus-4096a2e93b5fec3725c56c0a940dde995069d1f5.pYOvQr/claude.log`, and
`opus-4096a2e93b5fec3725c56c0a940dde995069d1f5.NtmhgZ/claude.log`, under the evidence root.
The first log is empty; the later two retain the OAuth failure.
The [Sifr blocker record](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3694#issuecomment-5553738037)
and [corpus blocker record](https://github.com/sifr-lang/leetcode/pull/48#issuecomment-5553738178) preserve the handoff publicly.

Exact next action: the account owner completes `claude auth login --claudeai` for the already-configured subscription account.
Then resume the initial exact-SHA review against the current record-only PR head, with both repository candidates identified.
Reuse valid qualification evidence. At most one remediation review and one merge-profile gate remain.
Do not run a create-PR gate, start another item, or merge without the required review and validation.

#### Item 12B required tests

These commands run from the isolated Sifr worktree after the bounded implementation.
The focused regression names are fixed before test execution.

```bash
cargo build -p sifr
cargo test -p sifr_codegen item12b_loop_sentinel_reuse
cargo test -p sifr_codegen item12b_repeat_count_reuse
cargo test -p sifr_codegen

cargo clippy -p sifr_codegen -- -D warnings
python3 scripts/check_file_size_guardrails.py
python3 scripts/check_hir_maintainability_guardrails.py
scripts/run_all_tests.sh
```

Apply the same `check` and `run` commands to every repaired corpus fixture.
Record the compiler SHA and binary digest for focused and full-corpus evidence.
Include relevant additional changed crates in the Clippy command.
Loop regressions cover repeated iterations, branch paths, and later sentinel uses.
Repeat-count regressions cover later uses, nested scopes, and effectful counts.

#### Item 12B checkpoint: qualification blocked on an unrelated Clippy defect

State on 2026-09-05: implementation checkpoint preserved; Item 12B is not closed.

- Sifr candidate: `673593f3ee234d58f03694e018abb145a843f787`,
  branch `codex/emitted-rust-excellence-item-12b`.
- External candidate: `330544ecf4f787c1a5fbed847469797ead92d24c`,
  branch `codex/item12b-source-contracts` in `sifr-lang/leetcode`.
- Both candidates are pushed. Neither repository has an Item 12B PR or merge.
- No Opus review or merge-profile gate was consumed.
- The isolated worktree remains `/tmp/sifr-item12b.akguMz/sifr`.
  The retained Item 12 compiler candidate remains separate and unchanged.

The newly built compiler has SHA-256
`56ef1dac97c474d76341f77aebefa37e750002bdf82e6a6f6c5509a91d85847c`.
The binary digest remained unchanged throughout this qualification attempt.

Completed evidence under `/tmp/sifr-item12b.akguMz/`:

- `codegen-singleton-full-2.log`: all 1,412 codegen tests pass.
  This includes all four named Item 12B ownership regressions.
- `compiler-singleton-build.log`: the compiler build passes.
- `native-primary/0004_median_of_two_sorted_arrays.json`: check and native run pass.
- `native-primary/0006_zigzag_conversion.json`: check and native run pass.
  Each JSON record contains both candidate SHAs, input digests, commands, and logs.
  These runs retain the original cases and execute the added ownership assertions.
- `cargo fmt --check`: pass.
- File-size guardrail: pass for 3,755 files, with the 900-line limit unchanged.
- HIR maintainability guardrail: pass.

Incomplete evidence is not a qualification pass:

- `leetcode-full-candidate.log` contains 113 passing cases before interruption.
  It is not a complete 411-case result.
- The two helper checks pass, but their native runs were interrupted.
  The remaining repaired fixtures still require their native runs.
- The worker stopped all owned qualification processes after the scope blocker.
  No background qualification process remains.
- Earlier complete diagnostic matrices cover earlier inputs.
  They do not qualify these candidates.

`clippy.log` records the blocker from
`cargo clippy -p sifr_codegen -- -D warnings`.
The unchanged `project_stdlib_nominals.rs:45` uses `Option::expect` in
`ProjectNominalRegistry::register_builtin`.
This defect exists in base `2dc4165fd9e7c34432a9b0d098188dc645aaca55` and current
main `2af89e75e5f97ec75e1b72c000fb3a6ebbbbb7cc`.
It concerns builtin-error registration, not sentinel or repeat-count ownership.
The worker did not suppress the diagnostic or import unrelated retained Item 12 code.

Next action: authorize or merge the builtin-registration repair recorded as Item 12C.
Then resume Item 12B qualification on the identified candidate inputs.
Complete every required fixture run and the canonical full corpus before review.
The exact-SHA review allowance and the single merge-profile gate remain unused.

#### Incorporated Item 12C: Builtin-registration scope amendment

- State: incorporated into Item 12B by explicit user authority on 2026-09-05.
- The earlier exclusion of this mechanism is superseded.
- This repair has no separate item, review, or gate.
- The implementation preserves both repository checkpoints and unrelated Item 12 work.
- Registration must consume validated builtin identity without a fallback,
  diagnostic suppression, or replacement panic.
- Focused command, recorded before execution:
  `cargo test -p sifr_codegen item12b_builtin_registration`.
- The regressions cover canonical identities, module shadows, and rejected non-builtin names.
- After this repair, resume the remaining Item 12B validation and closure steps.
- Owner: compiler builtin-error registration.
- Defect: `crates/sifr_codegen/src/project_stdlib_nominals.rs:45` fails strict
  Clippy with `clippy::expect_used`.
- Dependency: this unchanged defect blocks Item 12B's required crate Clippy check.
- The repair must preserve builtin-error identity and the registration invariant.
  It must not add a fallback or diagnostic suppression.

#### Item 12B checkpoint: builtin repair passes; native qualification fails

This checkpoint supersedes the earlier builtin-registration blocker.
Item 12C is implemented inside Item 12B. Item 12B is not closed.

- Sifr implementation candidate: `3f422b01633d23c2bc8d8ce8ca59057c6e56adea`.
- External candidate: `330544ecf4f787c1a5fbed847469797ead92d24c`.
- Both candidates are pushed. Neither repository has a PR or merge.
- No Opus review, remediation review, or merge-profile gate was consumed.
- The retained Item 12 compiler work remains separate and unchanged.

Registration now accepts a validated `BuiltinError` token.
The registry no longer performs a partial name lookup or calls `expect`.
Two regressions cover canonical identities, module shadows, and rejected non-builtin names.

The newly built compiler has SHA-256
`dbe640b31bdd181b93f82d967dd9e7c82092146482c554fb14e96fe42f28a3c3`.
The compiler binary and both source trees stayed unchanged throughout qualification.
Evidence is under `/tmp/sifr-item12b.akguMz/`:

- `builtin-focused.log`: both named builtin-registration regressions pass.
- `builtin-codegen-full.log`: all 1,414 codegen tests pass, including all four ownership regressions.
- `builtin-build.log`: the compiler build passes.
- `builtin-clippy.log`: strict codegen crate Clippy passes.
- Formatting, file-size (3,756 files), and HIR guardrails pass.
- `leetcode-full-3f422.log`: the complete canonical 411-case check finishes.
  It reports 410 passes and one failure, fixture 2002.
  This is a complete failing result, not a partial pass or native qualification.
  The canonical result is
  `target/verification/areas/algorithmic-compatibility-results.json`.
  Per-case results and taxonomy remain under
  `target/verification/areas/algorithmic_compatibility/`.
- `native-3f422/matrix.json`: complete coverage of all 90 changed source files.
  Checks pass for 89 files. Native builds and runs pass for 43 files.
  Native builds fail for 46 files. The failed check prevents the remaining native run.
  Median and zigzag both pass their checks and native assertions.
- `native-3f422/diagnostic_inventory.json`: every failing file, command, log, and diagnostic group.
  The following counts overlap where one file has several diagnostics.

| Diagnostic group | Files | Representative fixture |
|---|---:|---|
| Handler binding captured outside its scope | 13 | 0017 |
| Reused value moved | 12 | 0072 |
| Missing structured `TryExcept` lowering | 10 | 0044 |
| Narrowed value compared with `None` | 8 | 0102 |
| Missing `UnionFind.union` method emission | 4 | helpers/dsu |
| Recursive optional field mutability | 3 | 0025 |
| Nested assignment receives `Option<SifrInt>` instead of `SifrInt` | 1 | 0048 |
| Borrowed `str` clone emission | 1 | 1397 |
| Empty collection assertion type inference | 1 | 1203 |
| Unreceived checked shift result in source | 1 | 2002 |

The checked-shift receiving omission and approved ownership corrections remain Item 12B work.
They are not external authority blockers.
Other failures require control-flow, type-representation, or declaration-demand changes.
Those mechanisms are not builtin registration or sentinel/repeat reuse.

#### Later Item 12D: Native corpus emission dependencies

State: recorded for scope adjudication, not started.

<!-- Historical incoming Item12B record; later 12K dispatch is authoritative. -->
#### Item 12B continuation authority and regression commands

The user authorized all necessary next actions after the complete failure inventory.
The recorded execution dependencies now form part of the bounded Item 12B repair.
The previous scope-adjudication stop is superseded.
This includes checked-read control flow, exception capture and lowering, ownership,
method retention, assertion typing, and the checked-shift source omission.
It does not include unrelated Item 12 quality work or Item 12A.
The original review and single-gate limits remain unchanged.

Additional focused commands, recorded before test execution:

```bash
cargo test -p sifr_codegen item12b_
cargo test -p sifr_codegen item12b_exception_capture
cargo test -p sifr_codegen item12b_checked_read_control_flow
cargo test -p sifr_codegen item12b_repeated_value_ownership
cargo test -p sifr_codegen item12b_recursive_optional_mutability
cargo test -p sifr_codegen item12b_structured_exception
cargo test -p sifr_codegen item12b_method_retention
cargo test -p sifr_codegen item12b_empty_collection_assertion
```

The complete native matrix is the repair checklist, not a new discovery run.
Each regression must cover the relevant lexical, control-flow, or ownership negative case.
The new compiler requires new affected-input evidence. Earlier passes retain their recorded provenance.

The source batch also completes two missing checked-value contracts.
Fixture 2002 receives each checked shift into an explicit integer binding.
Fixture 0048 tests each optional matrix read before its corresponding write.
The matrix changes preserve read/write order and raise `IndexError` on absent values.
They do not substitute a default or remove an original case.

#### Item 12B integrated-base provenance

The complete `7f3930ab4b05cd5ab50edb897be6a56329ab43f6` native matrix passes 89/90 repaired fixtures.
All three previous residuals pass. Fixture 1472 exposes a nested arithmetic double borrow of an existing borrowed parameter.
The correction uses the existing binding-aware exact-integer operand adapter, not a new cloning rule.
Its exact focused command is recorded before execution:

```bash
cargo test -p sifr_codegen corpus_repair_nested_arithmetic_preserves_borrowed_parameter
```

Main PR #3693 (`b475ebdcd37081aa2860d9c348ace4100b546eff`) was integrated at `8d5afcb0c12a6115c54aadccee0e3fa87f478db0`.
Its naming-only changes leave compiler and algorithmic qualification inputs unchanged.
Only its changed demo inputs required regeneration; the canonical merge freshness check remains required.

The `d13954fd69a0dfb0e203a03cd5124d921d103539` residual native matrix passes 16/19 cases.
The remaining repairs cover nested mapping-default ownership and proven reads at optional call boundaries.
Fixture 1260 also requires explicit narrowing of optional position and cell reads before mutation.
These complete the existing ownership/read and external source-contract scope; no new item is started.
All existing corpus assertions remain unchanged.
Focused commands for this batch, recorded before execution:

```bash
cargo test -p sifr_codegen corpus_repair_repeated_value_ownership_nested_arithmetic_and_defaults
cargo test -p sifr_codegen corpus_repair_proven_read_at_optional_call_boundary
cargo test -p sifr_codegen corpus_repair_explicit_optional_nested_mutation_contract
cargo test -p sifr_codegen corpus_repair_
```

The final compiler must still pass all 90 repaired fixtures and the full canonical corpus.
The 16/19 residual pass is not whole-item qualification.

Main advanced to `c83dd7cde8daf54cdc4abd952903e9aa093c4183` through PR #3692.
Merge `b3d836354` integrates that reviewed base, including its dependency-feature normalization.
The test-module conflict keeps both new regression modules and main's renamed modules.
No retained Item 12 implementation was imported.

The merged naming policy forbids numbered planning labels in source names.
The new tests therefore use mechanism-oriented module names and the `corpus_repair_` filter.
This is a mechanical identity change; every case and assertion remains present.
The exact replacement focused command is recorded before execution:

```bash
cargo test -p sifr_codegen corpus_repair_
```

Main records unresolved SQL coverage classifications in
`ad-hoc-schema-first-sql-platform-review-follow-ups.md`.
They remain externally owned and are not absorbed into this dependency repair.
The single-gate limit is unchanged.

#### Item 12B continuation implementation evidence

The complete `7b50a83a91ce65dc17d91d73e54c14dcd1b67901` qualification has 411/411 canonical checks.
Its repaired-fixture matrix has 90/90 checks and 71/90 native passes.
The 19 native failures remain qualification failures, not a partial pass claim.
Raw evidence: `leetcode-full-continuation.log` and `native-continuation/diagnostic_inventory.json` under the owned temporary root.
The follow-up batch repairs those same mechanism paths: expression-local checked reads,
child-scope last-use accounting, owned argument adaptation, imported mutable receivers,
and empty assertions inside exception carriers. No unrelated Item 12 work is included.

Additional exact regression commands, recorded before execution:

```bash
cargo test -p sifr_codegen item12b_checked_read_control_flow_short_circuit_assignment
cargo test -p sifr_codegen item12b_structured_exception_root_error_and_dictionary_reads
cargo test -p sifr_codegen item12b_structured_exception_nested_while_checked_comparison
cargo test -p sifr_codegen item12b_repeated_value_ownership_condition_and_branch
cargo test -p sifr_codegen item12b_repeated_value_ownership_nested_arithmetic_and_defaults
cargo test -p sifr_codegen item12b_empty_collection_assertion_in_exception_carrier
```

Compiler implementation `580e3374c3aac2aa669ad06354fba02c618e0942` completes the recorded dependency batch.
Commit `18ab9bd969e70876a99875d8c719ad8b8d4daeb3` updates the existing union-rendering test expectation.
External candidate `0ef88e8b4f4906e410a3b2e9216248c11149b247` completes the two remaining source contracts.
No retained Item 12 compiler changes were imported.

- `continuation-focused-4.log`: all 17 Item 12B regressions pass.
- `continuation-codegen-full-2.log`: all 1,425 codegen tests pass.
- `continuation-clippy.log`: strict codegen Clippy passes.
- `continuation-build.log`: the new compiler build passes.
- Formatting and file-size/HIR guardrails pass; the size check covers 3,760 files.

The compiler binary SHA-256 is
`04e449044644533db98fad9289d89355078f12b3e3bbd9bdb77d7f42398dfbfa`.
These are focused and crate-level results, not full-corpus qualification.
The earlier complete failing matrices remain historical evidence.
No Opus review or merge-profile gate has run.

#### Incorporated Item 12D: Native corpus emission dependencies

State: incorporated into Item 12B under the continuation authority.
Owner: compiler emission, tracked in this issue and the algorithmic issue.
This item does not reopen Item 12C or request authority for its completed repair.

The confirmed scope blocker is checked-read control-flow and optional representation.
In fixture 0102, the source tests a left read only inside its left-length branch.
Generated Rust inserts a left-read `let Some(...) else { break; }` before that branch.
A second read narrows the value to `Vec<SifrInt>`, but its `None` comparison remains.
The first transformation can terminate a valid right-only iteration.
The second transformation fails Rust compilation with `E0277`.

Evidence: `native-3f422/0102.emitted.rs:116` and
`native-3f422/0102_binary_tree_level_order_traversal.run.log`.
The relevant producer is `crates/sifr_codegen/src/checked_place.rs`.
Its `checked_place_read_witness` path removes the optional representation.
This producer is unchanged from the isolated base.
A repair must preserve branch-local read demand, absence paths, and effect order.
Removing source guards or adding a fallback would not correct that mechanism.

The full diagnostic inventory also records structured exception lowering,
handler capture scope, missing method emission, and assertion type inference.
Their final producer-level decomposition remains unimplemented.
The ownership groups stay in Item 12B rather than moving into this later item.

Next action: adjudicate the newly recorded emission mechanisms as dependency scope.
Then finish the approved source and ownership corrections on the preserved branch.
Complete qualification on the final inputs before either repository merge.
The exact-SHA Opus allowance and single merge-profile gate remain unused.

All owned qualification commands completed. No background qualification run remains.
No compiler, fixture, test, baseline, or safety policy changed after this evidence.
Later commits update records only and do not claim a new implementation SHA pass.

#### Item 12B historical checkpoint

This later item records the blocker from the Item 12 worker. On 2026-09-05, the user authorized its repair by the same worker.

- State: blocked on native compiler ownership defects after the first source repairs.
- Owner: `sifr-lang/leetcode`, through the
  [owning issue](ad-hoc-algorithmic-full-corpus-preexisting-failures.md#2026-09-05-emitted-rust-item-12-qualification-blocker).
- Dependency: satisfied by explicit user authority for external corpus repairs and Sifr's corpus-pin update.
- Scope: reconcile the reported conversion-error and index-error handling contracts without weakening compiler safety or qualification rules.
- Required evidence: corrected median and zigzag fixtures pass their original cases, and the complete `leetcode-full` qualification passes.
- Test commands and approved external write scope are recorded in the owning issue under the qualification blocker.
- Execution: close Item 12B only, then stop. The latest one-item instruction supersedes the earlier multi-item continuation plan.
- The retained 30 Clippy diagnostics remain Item 12-owned compiler work. They do not belong to this external dependency item.
- Handoff: Helmholtz returned blocked at candidate `8ad089a9458f35fcfa228e93fe44f4d69731828b`. The same worker resumes with the new authority.
- The worker committed its evidence record as `77d4a238cab4ec2c44d2bff9b4b1e9745d8d1bac`. No implementation PR, Opus review, or merge gate exists.
- External checkpoint: `f6db5bd5d363b19a3040afd2a092f44ce32fd5bb` on
  `sifr-lang/leetcode`, branch `codex/item12b-source-contracts`.
  This checkpoint preserves median and zigzag source repairs and every original case.
  Both fixtures pass `check`. Both native runs fail with generated Rust `E0382`.
  Median moves its integer sentinels before reuse. Zigzag moves `numRows` before
  its later borrow. The expanded Item 12B authority now includes both mechanisms.
- The [owning issue record](ad-hoc-algorithmic-full-corpus-preexisting-failures.md#item-12b-native-qualification-blocker)
  contains the compiler identity, evidence paths, isolation details, and next action.
  No PR, review, or merge gate was consumed. Full-corpus qualification remains
  incomplete. No committed Sifr corpus-pin update exists.

<!-- Historical incoming Item12B record; later 12K dispatch is authoritative. -->
#### Item 12B implementation provenance

The compiler changes start from the merged base, not the retained Item 12 candidate.
The existing ownership materializer now serves integer local bindings and repeat counts.
Its rename does not change the other callers.
The repeat producer preserves operand order for both operand positions.
Singleton repetition uses the existing exact-integer range without a host-sized cast.
This correction also satisfies the two existing singleton-repeat codegen tests.

The median fixture adds native loop, branch, sentinel-reuse, and large-integer assertions.
The zigzag fixture adds native repeat-count, operand-order, and single-evaluation assertions.
Both fixtures retain every original case.
External repairs propagate checked errors through explicit receiving contexts.
Reassignments retain their original binding identity and statement order.

### Item 12A: Phase closure and whole-phase review

- [ ] One exact-SHA whole-phase agent review is satisfied.
- [ ] Architecture and roadmap records reflect the delivered architecture.
- [ ] This issue is archived only after every closure condition is true.
- [ ] Closure contains no compiler implementation work. If the whole-phase
  review finds a new implementation mechanism defect, create a later
  implementation item and a subsequent closure item instead of repairing it
  inside Item 12A or taking a third review round.

The initial slice-step panic was fixed. The remediation review's new exact-ratio proof/codegen mismatch is assigned to Item 3 under the no-third-review rule. | Canonical inline-small/`BigInt` `SifrInt`, exact arithmetic and conversion paths, fixed-width boundaries, constants, ranges, collections, unions, and Rust/Python interop merged with debug/release and corpus evidence. |

The sole create-PR run passed every functional check but exceeded the runtime-platform step budget after the required cold-cache cleanup; its later warm merge run passed that area in 24.5 seconds. The sole merge run passed core language, CPython differential, Rust/Python interop, diagnostics, runtime, algorithmic, tooling, and all emitted-Rust corpus, panic-scan, rustfmt, Clippy, determinism, and freshness checks.

## Deferred Findings

| Source | Finding | Owner | Required action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Item 1 remediation review | Three idealized, non-authoritative companions were removed while their sibling sources remain. | Item 8 | Decide whether the sources require authoritative emitted companions; regenerate from the Item 8 compiler when required, otherwise preserve their explicit non-authoritative status through closure. |
| Item 1 remediation review | ERQ-025 still describes the fifteen legacy demo `main.rs` files removed by Item 1. | Item 8 | Close the already-discharged row when Item 8 reconciles stale snapshots and generated ceremony. |
| Item 1 remediation review | The exact discovery inventory is broader than the 91-project executable quality corpus. | Item 12 | State and verify the intended qualification relationship, and ensure final full-corpus closure cannot leave an inventoried entrypoint class unexercised. |
| Item 1 remediation review | Checked-in emitted companions receive freshness and safety scans but are not individually governed by rustfmt and Clippy. | Item 8 | Regenerate or remove the remaining producer debt and make authoritative checked-in output satisfy the canonical formatting/lint contract. |
| Item 2 remediation review | A reduced exact-integer quotient can be float-representable even when either original operand is not; lowering proves the reduced ratio while infallible codegen independently calls `to_f64_proven_exact` on each operand, leaving a source-reachable proof panic. | Item 3 | Make the static proof and emitted operation share one precondition, add the cancelled-large-factor regression, and remove the data-dependent proof assertion from generated user paths. |
| Item 2 remediation review | Exact integer true division loses Python's negative-zero sign for a zero numerator and negative denominator. | Item 6 | Derive a zero quotient's sign from both operands and add signed-zero differential coverage. |
| Item 2 remediation review | Rejected slice-step lowering records an error but recovers with a step-less slice HIR node, which can produce misleading cascading diagnostics. | Item 3 | Propagate failed step lowering consistently with failed start/stop lowering while preserving the primary typed diagnostic and source span. |
| Item 2 merge-gate diagnostics | `SIFR-INT-0006` remains registered and documented although source exact-integer true division now lowers to a typed `Result` and misuse renders contextual `SIFR-TYPE-0002`; only the lower-level type-system path still produces the old code. | Item 3 | Retire the unreachable registry, renderer, test, catalog, and documentation path, or restore a justified source-reachable typed-failure use with a rendered baseline. |
| Item 2 merge-gate diagnostics | `SIFR-TYPE-0901` retains a warning IR variant, renderer, registry entry, catalog, and docs after exact arithmetic removed its final producer. | Item 8 | Remove the dead warning mechanism and regenerate all diagnostic governance artifacts. |
| Item 2 gate output | The Python Arrow resource implementation retains an unused private `handle` method. | Item 8 | Remove the dead method through the canonical support implementation and prove generated support remains warning-clean. |
| Item 2 generated-project inspection | Source constants generate helper names such as `__const_BASE`, retaining avoidable non-snake-case naming debt. | Item 8 | Canonicalize generated constant helper names and references without broad naming allowances, including project imports and re-exports. |
| Item 3 initial review | Bare `return` in a binding-promoting `try`/`except` inside `Result[None, E]` can emit the wrong optional/control-flow payload. | Item 8 | Unify none-like return normalization across direct, optional, and binding-promotion carriers. |
| Item 3 initial review | `break` and `continue` inside `try`/`finally` nested in a loop can escape into a Rust closure and fail with E0267. | Item 8 | Represent loop control structurally in the canonical try/finally carrier. |
| Item 3 initial review | `raise` can type-check in a non-`Result` function and then emit an incompatible Rust `Err`. | Item 8 | Reject the invalid source path before emission through canonical return/error validation. |
| Item 3 initial review | Phase 34 still claims retired `SIFR-INT-0006` behavior. | Item 8 | Reconcile stale historical generated-code records with the current diagnostic surface. |
| Item 3 initial review | Pre-render forbidden-failure validation checks `MacroCall` but not `FormatMacro`. | Item 8 | Cover every macro-bearing Rust IR variant with one structural validation path and mutation evidence. |
| Item 3 initial review | Exact literal materialization can leave source bindings unread in emitted Rust. | Item 8 | Remove dead generated bindings through canonical liveness/simplification rather than warning allowances. |
| Item 3 remediation review | A cleared local exact-integer fact can fall back to a same-named module constant and fold the wrong value. | Item 3A | Make exact-integer proof lookup binding-identity aware and add local-shadow regressions. |
| Item 3 remediation review | A nested function called in a loop can mutate a `nonlocal` integer without invalidating the enclosing loop-carried fact. | Item 3A | Model called nested-function mutation in loop fact invalidation and prove while/for/async-for behavior. |
| Item 3 remediation review | Async-for constant-fact invalidation lacks a dedicated regression. | Item 3A | Add exact async-for evidence alongside the repaired mutation mechanism. |
| Item 3 remediation review | Nested loops re-walk inner bodies once per enclosing level. | Item 9 | Replace repeated body collection with a single pre-pass or memoized summary and enforce a lowering-cost regression. |
| Item 3 generated safety scan | Remaining direct collection indexing is the only generated panic-surface class in the full corpus. | Item 4 | Route every read, write, delete, and nested place through the checked-place architecture. |
| Item 3 merge gate | Suppressed Python-context body errors can leave an enclosing direct-return try carrier expecting `Result` while the emitted suppression arm yields unit. | Item 3A | Make context suppression a typed continuation in static flow analysis and sync/async emission; compile and run the SQLite context example plus reduced regressions. |
| Item 3A initial review | Callable-alias effect closure currently shares mutation summaries with retained-callback contract inference and can overstate `FnMut` requirements for callbacks that do not invoke the alias. | Item 7 | Separate const-fact call effects from retained-callback ownership contracts and add a retained-callback regression before changing inference. |
| Item 3A initial review | Nested-function local-definition collection does not explicitly account for Python context-manager item targets, which can misclassify a context target as an outer capture. | Item 7 | Make captured-binding analysis account for every binding-producing statement, including `with` and `async with` targets, with ownership regressions. |
| Item 3A initial review | Pattern rendering recognizes `true` and `false` as literals even though source identifier validation does not yet reserve those Rust spellings consistently. | Item 8 | Centralize legal generated-name and literal-pattern handling so a source identifier cannot silently change pattern meaning. |
| Item 3A remediation review | Exact imported/module integer facts use a bare-name module map whose immutability and invalidation boundary is implicit. | Item 8 | Encode or assert the module-frame immutability invariant, preferably through binding identity, and document the distinct invalidation boundary before mutable globals can exist. |
| Item 3A local Clippy audit | Strict workspace/all-target Clippy exposes untouched compiler and test lint debt, including annotation-resolution needless borrowing and structural-record ownership/`expect` findings. | Item 8 | Remove the underlying lint debt without broad allowances and make maintained compiler/test surfaces warning-clean under the phase policy. |
| Item 3A merge gate | The generated-code surface inventory expects 701 E2E pass sources, but the exact Item 3A base and candidate both contain the same 704 paths and digest `ef6a17a107fa114027c96eb2947afc71430a781834df64b97df608629dc10b87`. | Item 8 | Refresh the authoritative inventory from the owning producer and add it to stale generated-record reconciliation; Item 3A added or removed no E2E source path. |
| Item 3A create-PR gate | A required first cold-cache run exceeded the runtime-platform 120-second step budget although all 28 variants passed; the warmed merge run completed the same area in 24.5 seconds. | Item 12 | Ensure final qualification budgets distinguish mandated cold-cache setup from warm blocking evidence and retain both timing receipts. |
| Item 4 remediation review | A checked-place witness established outside a loop can survive a mutating loop back-edge, producing stale list values or an E0502 dictionary borrow on later iterations. | Item 4A | Invalidate before entering any repeatable block whose body mutates a witness dependency, and establish a fresh checked read inside each iteration before use. |
| Item 4 remediation review | Refresh after deletion reuses the original membership guard's exit action, so a later missing read can return the guard fallback instead of raising the operation's typed missing-key error. | Item 4A | Derive the refreshed read's failure continuation from the post-mutation operation rather than replaying proof-establishment control flow. |
| Item 4 create-PR and merge gates | Callback argument decoding replaced direct vector indexing with an underconstrained fixed-array `try_into`; one-argument callback examples fail Rust inference with E0282. | Item 4A | Emit an explicit fixed-array type or an equivalent type-directed checked decoder for every callback arity, with Python interop regressions. |
| Item 4 full generated-quality run | All 91 governed rustfmt cases retained their expected individual classification, but changed emitted source produced aggregate signature `c62a991cbb6e89aa92fa2cd0514ed03433d88b135fb662f52ab19527ca955687` instead of the locked Item 1 signature. | Item 8 | Remove the underlying formatting debt through canonical Rust IR/emission cleanup; do not rebase the exact debt signature to changed debt. |
| Item 4A remediation review | Async-for does not restore sequence guards after its body, so a proof established only inside a possibly zero-iteration loop can escape and authorize a later checked read. | Item 4B | Give async-for the same save/restore guard-state bracket as sync loops and prove zero-iteration behavior. |
| Item 4A remediation review | A loop-carried witness without an original missing action wraps the entire body in `if let`; in a `while`, indirect mutation can then skip the progress update forever. | Item 4B | Make loop-kind control flow override the branch fallback at refresh sites and prove the missing path terminates or advances. |
| Item 4A remediation review | Negative loop-invalidation regressions assert only that lowering failed, and async-for refresh lacks native runtime coverage. | Item 4B | Assert the checked-place diagnostic identity and add ordinary plus closable async-for runtime regressions. |
| Item 4A remediation review | A key read in both a while condition and body can be refreshed twice per iteration. | Item 9 | Deduplicate condition and body refresh plans and include the operation count in emitted-complexity evidence. |
| Item 4A direct full E2E | `parsers_and_encoders` and `structured_data_formats` deterministically disagree on JSON object order because the isolated generated group enables `serde_json` without `preserve_order`. | Item 6 | Reconcile generated JSON map-order semantics with the language contract and add deterministic isolated-group coverage. |
| Item 4A create-PR and merge gates | Both generated verification profiles omit the required `postgresql-live-differential` suite and therefore fail before running tests. | Item 12 | Repair or reconcile final qualification profile composition so required platform suites are selected and preflight passes. |
| Item 4B initial review | Straight-line mutation-tail refresh still replays an earlier witness missing action or wraps the remaining tail in body-skipping `if let` when no action exists. | Item 4C | Invalidate mutable-call dependencies before lowering and derive the fresh read from its current operation contract; never skip or replay the proof-establishment path. |
| Item 4B remediation review | An outer loop witness's stored missing action can be emitted inside a deeply nested inner loop/branch mutation tail, targeting the wrong loop and, after Item 4B, assigning the outer `_broke` marker. | Item 4C | Scope refresh continuations to the current structured region and prove outer `while ... else` plus inner `for`/`if` mutation/read behavior. |
| Item 4B remediation review | Simple loop lowering independently constructs `_broke = true; break` instead of sharing the structured emitter's canonical helper. | Item 4C | Route simple and structured loop breaks through one canonical constructor and cross-path regressions. |
| Item 4B remediation review | Condition-refresh plus `while ... else` has native evidence but no direct codegen shape assertion. | Item 4C | Add a unit assertion for `_broke = true` before the condition-refresh break and preserve the natural condition-false bare break. |
| Item 4B remediation review | Loop-invalidated optional reads report the downstream unsupported operator rather than a dedicated proof-invalidation diagnostic. | Item 8 | Decide the canonical user-facing diagnostic during structured emission cleanup and add governed rendering evidence if a dedicated code is warranted. |
| Item 4B native remediation fixture | A `while ... else` whose else body returns and is followed by another return can emit a non-exhaustive Rust `if` in value position (E0317). | Item 8 | Normalize loop-else tail/control-flow representation in structured Rust IR and add the return-ending else regression. |
| Item 4C exact-SHA review | Receiver-mutating calls are not represented by `mutable_arg_places`; checked-place invalidation therefore depends on lowering's currently incomplete fixed builtin receiver-mutation list. | Item 7 | Unify mutable receiver and argument effect summaries with the explicit ownership plan, then add user-defined `mut self`, class-method, and builtin shrinking-method checked-place regressions. |
| Item 4C exact-SHA review | Borrowed witness preparation inserts element clones before mutation without proving or diagnosing a `Clone` requirement for non-copy class elements. | Item 7 | Make witness preservation participate in the explicit ownership/clone plan and add a `list[NonCopyClass]` regression that either borrows safely or reports a Sifr diagnostic before Rust compilation. |
| Item 4C exact-SHA review | Straight-line renewal uses the previous binding as the absent fallback; current lowering makes absence unreachable for surviving guard-preserving mutations, but the reachability invariant is implicit. | Item 8 | Encode the refresh precondition structurally or validate it before rendering, and add negative mutation evidence so a future new mutation form cannot silently retain stale data. |
| Item 4C exact-SHA review | Loop-else setup and dispatch scaffolds remain duplicated across structured loop emitters even though the break-marker constructor is now canonical. | Item 8 | Give canonical Rust IR one loop-else scaffold constructor and prove sync, async, and statement-block paths render the same structure. |
| Item 4C broad validation | `numeric_sentinels.sifr` is still classified as an E2E pass fixture although `nums[l]` lacks a statically established index proof and fails with `None | int`; exact Item 4C base and candidate agree. | Item 8 | Reconcile the fixture with the checked-place contract or implement a sound proof mechanism, then restore the non-E2E Sifr sweep without weakening optional-read diagnostics. |
| Item 4C create-PR and merge gates | Both current verification profiles omit required `postgresql-live-differential` and `postgresql-live-runtime` suites and stop at preflight before running tests. | Item 12 | Repair final profile composition and retain a mutation test proving every required SQL platform suite is selected before the one final qualification run. |
| Item 5 initial review | Nested generator lowering can reach the statement-block yield path with `in_generator_closure` false and emit an undefined `__sifr_yielder`; the new architecture did not introduce the former dangling-support behavior. | Item 8 | Represent nested generator bodies through the canonical structured generator-emission path or reject the unsupported form before Rust emission, with direct nested-function coverage. |
| Item 5 initial review | The owned-iterator adaptations deliberately require explicit `iter(...)`, and `islice(it, start, None)` does not yet model CPython's unbounded-tail form. | Item 6 | Decide and document the language-level iterator ownership/parity contract, then add differential coverage for explicit ownership and the optional-stop form. |
| Item 5 remediation review | `cycle` advances its output count without yielding when an instantiated optional element is represented by `None`, so optional-element sources can be dropped or miscounted. | Item 6 | Give generic optional values an unambiguous element representation in `cycle` and add focused optional-element semantic coverage. |
| Item 5 full generated-quality and direct E2E runs | The generated surface inventory expects 705 E2E paths while the current tree has 718; aggregate rustfmt debt also changed although every one of the 91 individual project classifications passed. | Item 8 | Reconcile the authoritative inventory and remove producer formatting debt through canonical emission; do not bless a changed aggregate debt signature. |
| Item 5 direct full E2E | `sliding_window_narrowing.sifr` emits an `Option<String>` key into `HashSet<String>::remove`, causing one generated compile defect to fan out across 279 fixtures after a cold rebuild. | Item 8 | Normalize the checked optional index/place before method-argument emission and add an isolated native regression before restoring the broad E2E sweep. |
| Item 5 create-PR and merge gates | Both profiles omit required SQL platform suites `host-tools`, `postgresql-live-differential`, and `postgresql-live-runtime`, so both one-shot gates stopped at preflight before tests. | Item 12 | Repair final profile composition and preserve mutation coverage proving every required SQL suite is selected before the phase's final qualification run. |
| Item 6 initial review | Compiler-special `open()` default metadata is keyed by a bare class name, so a same-basename user class can receive synthetic defaults despite distinct nominal identity. | Item 8 | Key compiler-owned method defaults by canonical class identity and add a same-basename negative regression. |
| Item 6 initial review | The single-argument unbounded form `islice(it, None)` remains unsupported although `islice(it, start, None)` is implemented. | Item 12 | Complete and document the remaining iterator parity form during full-corpus semantic closure. |
| Item 6 initial review | New IO carriers retain redundant nested clones such as `(size.clone()).clone()`. | Item 7 | Eliminate the redundant ownership operations through the explicit clone plan and include the new IO shapes in clone budgets. |
| Item 6 remediation review | Propagated arithmetic bounds copy the callee's embedded type-parameter spelling into the caller, so differently named `Addable` forwarding can emit an out-of-scope Rust type and fail with E0412. | Item 6A | Represent parameterized bounds structurally or substitute the formal parameter with each corresponding caller parameter; add lowering, emitted-shape, and native forwarding evidence. |
| Item 6 remediation review | Generic class-method bounds and module-level function bounds use disjoint closures, leaving class-method forwarding outside the repaired mechanism. | Item 8 | Unify generic-bound demand across free functions and class methods through canonical callable identity, with a class-method forwarding regression. |
| Item 6 remediation review | Local-scope-only call collection excludes generic callees invoked from nested functions or closures inside a generic body. | Item 8 | Model lexical generic-call effects explicitly and prove nested forwarding without leaking nested-only demands into unrelated scopes. |
| Item 6 remediation review | Structural-mismatch fallback can propagate a callee's full bound set to every caller parameter mentioned inside one composite actual type. | Item 8 | Replace fallback over-constraint with structural parameter correspondence and add multi-parameter composite regressions. |
| Item 6 remediation review | Generic-bound requirements and callee lookup use bare function names, leaving same-named generic functions vulnerable to cross-contamination. | Item 8 | Key the closure by canonical function identity and prove same-basename functions remain distinct. |
| Item 6 create-PR and merge gates | Both profiles omit required SQL suites `host-tools`, `migration-engine`, `postgresql-live-differential`, `postgresql-live-migrations`, `postgresql-live-runtime`, `postgresql-live-schema-tools`, `postgresql-migrations`, and `schema-tools`, so both one-shot gates stopped at preflight. | Item 12 | Reconcile final profile composition and retain mutation coverage proving every required SQL suite is selected before final qualification. |
| Item 6A exact-SHA review | `Addable` admits `str`, but generic `+` emits owned right-hand operands and therefore requires unavailable `String: Add<String>` instead of Rust's `String: Add<&str>`. | Item 7 | Make generic binary ownership and bounds agree with every admitted `Addable` member, and add a string instantiation beside the integer forwarding fixture. |
| Item 6A exact-SHA review | The hand-authored, non-authoritative `demos/protocol_bounds/idiomatic.rs` no longer mirrors the source demo's added `relay_add` behavior. | Item 8 | Reconcile or retire non-authoritative idiomatic companions under the canonical generated-snapshot policy. |
| Item 6A create-PR and merge gates | Both profiles omit required SQL suites `host-tools`, `migration-engine`, `postgresql-live-differential`, `postgresql-live-migrations`, `postgresql-live-runtime`, `postgresql-live-schema-tools`, `postgresql-migrations`, `schema-polymorphism`, and `schema-tools`, so both one-shot gates stopped at preflight. | Item 12 | Reconcile final profile composition and prove every currently required SQL suite is selected before final qualification. |
| Item 7 initial review | Unguarded dictionary value reads and dictionary/set lookup-key borrowing retain a silent fallback and `Borrow<&str>`-family mismatch that reproduce on the exact base. | Item 8 | Normalize checked optional-place reads and borrowed lookup keys through canonical Rust IR without silent values or double-reference query types. |
| Item 7 remediation review | Convention-driven receiver invalidation currently clears length and membership facts for growth-only and proof-preserving operations after the legacy shrinking-only summary was removed. | Item 7A | Introduce one typed receiver-effect summary that invalidates only facts an operation can falsify; prove growth, removal, and positional-reordering behavior. |
| Item 7 remediation review | `methods/dict.rs::lower_setdefault` relies on registry callers to materialize key/default ownership, while the local-binding fallback emitter can reach the operation without that contract. | Item 7A | Put owned key/default materialization at the shared `setdefault` boundary or route every entrypoint through one prepared-argument plan, with reaching shape/native evidence. |
| Item 7 remediation review | Registry literal and entry boundaries clone every non-copy named local even when the value is dead after the operation. | Item 9 | Add ownership-plan last-use move promotion and allocation budgets without weakening reuse semantics. |
| Item 7 remediation review | Nested generic functions with source bounds are rejected before codegen, so support-demand closure has no nested bound source today. | Item 8 | Reconcile nested generic declaration support or preserve an explicit checked rejection while canonical generic callable identity is implemented. |
| Item 7 create-PR and merge gates | Both profiles omit required SQL suites `host-tools`, `migration-engine`, `mysql-live`, `mysql-provider`, `postgresql-live-differential`, `postgresql-live-migrations`, `postgresql-live-runtime`, `postgresql-live-schema-tools`, `postgresql-migrations`, `schema-polymorphism`, and `schema-tools`, so both one-shot gates stopped at preflight. | Item 12 | Reconcile final profile composition and prove every currently required SQL suite is selected before final qualification. |
| Item 7A remediation review | Growth preserves a non-`None` fact for negative indices even though append/extend changes which element an end-relative index names. | Item 7B | Classify end-relative subscript facts separately and invalidate their exact value fact on growth, with append/extend negative-index regressions and preserved nonnegative evidence. |
| Item 7A remediation review | Affine `setdefault` storage arguments bypass materialization, but the returned-value path and evidence do not yet establish one valid affine ownership contract. | Item 7B | Prove and implement the operation's affine return contract or reject the unsupported surface before emission; add reaching emitted/native evidence. |
| Item 7A remediation review | Statement-position `setdefault` still computes a discarded cloned return value. | Item 9 | Make emission context and last-use planning avoid return-value materialization when the result is discarded, with clone/allocation budgets. |
| Item 7A remediation review | `PythonBuffer.write` is classified as value mutation and preserves receiver facts without an explicit proof that no relevant sequence fact can target the buffer. | Item 7B | Prove the fact-domain exclusion or conservatively invalidate relevant facts, with a receiver-summary regression. |
| Item 7A create-PR and merge gates | Both profiles omit required SQL suites `host-tools`, `migration-engine`, `mysql-live`, `mysql-provider`, `postgresql-live-differential`, `postgresql-live-migrations`, `postgresql-live-runtime`, `postgresql-live-schema-tools`, `postgresql-migrations`, `schema-polymorphism`, and `schema-tools`, so both one-shot gates stopped at preflight. | Item 12 | Reconcile final profile composition and prove every currently required SQL suite is selected before final qualification. |
| Item 7B exact-SHA review | `JoinSet` shares the no-relevant-sequence-facts domain with `PythonBuffer`; this is sound for today's growth-only mutable methods but a future removal method could inherit preservation silently. | Item 8 | Make fact-domain eligibility structural and exhaustive per receiver operation, and cover every mutable non-collection method in the summary regression. |
| Item 7B exact-SHA review | Growth stability is conservatively derived from literal index sign, so variable list indices over-invalidate and dict keys carry irrelevant growth metadata. | Item 8 | Derive reference stability from canonical typed index facts and receiver kind without weakening negative-index soundness. |
| Item 7B exact-SHA review | The generic reusable-value method set retains an unreachable `setdefault` affine branch after the dedicated ownership rejection. | Item 8 | Give the affine `setdefault` contract one canonical diagnostic owner and remove the unreachable generic branch. |
| Item 7B exact-SHA review | Defensive affine `setdefault` codegen declines with `None`, which would become a silent lowering miss if the frontend contract regressed. | Item 8 | Replace defensive silent decline with a structured internal codegen invariant diagnostic while preserving the source-facing rejection. |
| Item 7B create-PR and merge gates | Both profiles omit required SQL suites `host-tools`, `migration-engine`, `mysql-live`, `mysql-provider`, `postgresql-live-differential`, `postgresql-live-migrations`, `postgresql-live-runtime`, `postgresql-live-schema-tools`, `postgresql-migrations`, `schema-polymorphism`, and `schema-tools`, so both one-shot gates stopped at preflight. | Item 12 | Reconcile final profile composition and prove every currently required SQL suite is selected before final qualification. |
| Item 8 package validation | Exact `origin/main` `74bbb636744adaacb8c3eca09108b6fff9725357` fails two TypeVar diagnostic-message assertions after the producer wording changed from “simple type name(s)” to “type name(s)” without updating the tests. | [#3667](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3667) | Repair the stale exact-message expectations in their own owner; Item 8 does not change TypeVar semantics or absorb this exact-base failure. |
| Item 8 package validation | Exact `origin/main` `74bbb636744adaacb8c3eca09108b6fff9725357` fails `tests::attached_api_codegen::non_string_leaf_negative_is_package_compilable` because its checked-in fixture lock is stale. | [#3669](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3669) | Refresh and govern the attached-API fixture lock in its own owner; Item 8 does not absorb an exact-base artifact failure. |
| Item 8 remediation review | Shared `if` suffix factoring can move a token-identical effect after branch-local values are dropped because its guard proves name disjointness but not effect/drop-order equivalence. | Item 8A / [#3670](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3670) | Make suffix factoring effect- and drop-order-aware, with direct non-Copy/Drop and side-effect regressions. |
| Item 8 remediation review | IR dead-binding cleanup treats every binary expression with pure operands as discardable while syntax cleanup deliberately treats unknown binary effects conservatively. | Item 8A / [#3670](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3670) | Give both layers one conservative discardability contract and prove unknown operator effects survive. |
| Item 8 remediation review | Private-field pruning can delete side-effecting struct-literal initializers and omits nested-module demand. | Item 8A / [#3670](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3670) | Preserve initializer effects and traverse qualified nested-module references before pruning. |
| Item 8 remediation review | Iterator, length, and `None` rewrites rely on names or token shapes that can match incompatible `Option`, `Result`, slice, or non-option operations. | Item 8A / [#3670](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3670) | Require structural/type proof for each rewrite and add negative lookalike regressions. |
| Item 8 remediation review | Three format-capture collectors are duplicated and omit dynamic width/precision captures such as `{:width$}`. | Item 8A / [#3670](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3670) | Consolidate capture parsing and prove all liveness consumers preserve width/precision bindings. |
| Item 8 remediation review | Per-package generated Clippy cleanup can invalidate a shared target when two quality runs overlap. | Item 8A / [#3670](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3670) | Isolate or synchronize cleanup while retaining deterministic diagnostics and explicit concurrency evidence. |
| Item 8 merge gate | The sole merge gate passed every Item 8 guardrail and stopped in coverage/taxonomy readiness on unclassified SQL packages/targets and stale SQL milestone wording; no reported failure path changed in Item 8. | Item 12 | Reconcile the final coverage/profile taxonomy and prove every current SQL package and target is classified before final qualification. |
| Item 8A exact-SHA review | `assignment_cleanup.rs` still deletes some unused initializers through a separate name-based purity rule instead of the shared conservative discardability contract. | Item 12 | Route every deletion-adjacent cleanup through one proved discardability contract and add effectful lookalike regressions. |
| Item 8A exact-SHA review | Implicit captures in `panic!`, `unreachable!`, and `todo!` are not recognized by the shared format parser's macro-family routing. | Item 12 | Make macro-family coverage explicit and exhaustive, or prove those macros cannot occur on governed generated surfaces. |
| Item 8A exact-SHA review | Struct literals nested inside macro token streams are invisible to private-field demand, effect retention, and pruning. | Item 12 | Traverse or conservatively retain macro-contained struct construction so definitions and literals cannot diverge. |
| Item 8A exact-SHA review | The `Option[str]` length callback uses `String::len` byte length while ordinary Sifr string length counts Unicode scalar values. | Item 12 | Emit the canonical character-count operation for optional strings and add non-ASCII semantic coverage. |
| Item 8A exact-SHA review | IR iterator classification in `stmt_support_emitter/iterator_lowering.rs` still uses method names instead of structural type proof. | Item 12 | Replace the remaining name-based iterator classification with the canonical typed proof and negative lookalike coverage. |
| Item 8A exact-SHA review | Failed generated-Clippy runs preserve invocation-owned Cargo targets, which can accumulate substantial disk usage. | Item 12 | Add bounded evidence retention or explicit safe cleanup while preserving failed-run diagnostics and concurrent isolation. |
| Item 8A create-PR and merge gates | Both one-shot gates passed every reached Item 8A guardrail and Rust interop check, then stopped on the unchanged unclassified SQL packages/targets and stale SQL milestone taxonomy already reproduced by Item 8. | Item 12 | Reconcile coverage/profile taxonomy and prove every current SQL package and target is classified before final qualification. |
| Item 9 remediation review | Allocation-free `Char`/`Str` comparison collapses an absent indexed character and a present empty or multi-character string to the same `None`, making out-of-range equality true and inequality false. | Item 9A / [#3676](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3676) | Keep absence distinct from failed single-character extraction across operand order, literals, variables, optionals, Unicode, and both comparison operators without restoring one-character allocation. |
| Item 9 remediation review | The unified body prepass does not record the `anext(x)` mutation source retained by the previous query implementation. | Item 12 | Reconcile iterator-advance mutation fidelity in the canonical prepass and add a reachable negative or proof that the omitted fact cannot affect witnesses or narrowing. |
| Item 9 remediation review | Isinstance-arm mutation now includes signature and nested-capture effects and can conservatively add `mut` bindings beyond the former query. | Item 12 | Remove any resulting generated `unused_mut` debt while preserving the wider sound mutation analysis. |
| Item 9 remediation review | `demos/compiler_safety/main.sifr` changed its callable-field behavior and asserted output even though Item 9 required producer and generated-companion work, not demo behavior changes. | Item 9A / [#3676](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3676) | Restore the prior demo contract or move the coverage under an explicit semantic owner, then regenerate the authoritative companion. |
| Item 9 generated-project validation | Fresh generated text/i18n projects resolve `tinyvec 1.13.0`, which fails to compile under Rust 1.98; changing only the temporary generated lock to the workspace-compatible `tinyvec 1.11.0` passes. | Item 11 | Give generated projects a reproducible, toolchain-compatible dependency-resolution contract and prove fresh materialization without hand-edited temporary locks. |
| Item 9 initial review | The checked-read collector's narrow lowering path can fail closed on nested boolean conditions and lose optimization facts even though semantic lowering remains correct. | Item 12 | Reconcile checked-read collection with canonical short-circuit condition lowering and add negative lookalike and nested-boolean coverage. |
| Item 9 create-PR and merge gates | Both one-shot gates passed every reached Item 9 guardrail and Rust interop check, then stopped on the unchanged unclassified SQL packages/targets and stale SQL milestone taxonomy already owned by Item 12. | Item 12 | Reconcile coverage/profile taxonomy and prove every current SQL package and target is classified before final qualification. |
| Item 9A exact-SHA review | A string variable retaining `Type::LiteralStr(_)` takes the allocation-free runtime `chars()` comparison-state path instead of the compile-time literal specialization. | Item 12 | Preserve correctness while extending compile-time single-scalar/invalid-width specialization to literal-typed bindings when canonical constant evidence is available. |
| Item 9A exact-SHA review | The restored `compiler_safety` source intentionally discards `c.callback(c.value)` to keep the callable field live, but the reason is not documented at the source site. | Item 12 | Add a concise source comment or equivalent self-documenting coverage without changing the restored observable output contract. |
| Item 9A generated Clippy validation | Existing `emitted_rust_item9_complexity` output triggers `clippy::missing_const_for_fn` for `signed_zero_key`. | Item 12 | Remove the producer-level residual and prove strict generated Clippy over the governed complexity fixture without rebasing debt. |
| Item 9A exact-SHA review | An ignored local file named `crates/sifr/tests/e2e/pass/Untitled` is present in this worktree's governed fixture directory, although it does not match the `*.sifr` inventory. | Item 12 | During final corpus qualification, verify the fixture root contains no unexplained local artifacts and remove this file only after confirming ownership. |
| Item 9A create-PR and merge gates | Both one-shot gates passed every reached Item 9A guardrail and Rust interop check, then stopped on the unchanged unclassified SQL packages/targets and stale SQL milestone taxonomy already owned by Item 12. | Item 12 | Reconcile coverage/profile taxonomy and prove every current SQL package and target is classified before final qualification. |
| Item 10 remediation review | Project-wide merging unions module-local builtin-error suppressions into a crate-wide veto, so one module's user-defined `ValueError` can remove builtin support required by a sibling and leave dangling Rust paths. | Item 10A / [#3682](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3682) | Preserve exact module identities and make late builtin-error demand module-aware across project and test-project generation. |
| Item 10 remediation review | The project nominal registry keys builtin and user-defined error classes by bare name, allowing a same-basename user class to be silently replaced by the builtin identity. | Item 10A / [#3682](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3682) | Separate builtin identity from module-qualified user error identity and compile/run the cross-module collision fixture. |
| Item 10 remediation review | `referenced_error_classes_with_source` is production-unused, and the flat support-trait ownership assumption is implicit. | Item 10A / [#3682](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3682) | Remove or integrate the dead helper and encode or enforce the flat generated-support trait invariant. |
| Item 10 create-PR and merge gates | Both one-shot gates passed every reached Item 10 guardrail and Rust interop check, then stopped on the unchanged unclassified SQL packages/targets and stale SQL milestone taxonomy already owned by Item 12. | Item 12 | Reconcile coverage/profile taxonomy and prove every current SQL package and target is classified before final qualification. |
| Item 10A exact-SHA review | The static class-adapter negative fixture lock lacks the existing `memchr` dependency and fails `cargo metadata --locked`. | Item 11 / [#3685](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3685) | Refresh the fixture lock through its owning workflow and prove locked package-compilability. |
| Item 10A exact-SHA review | Generated support trait-layout errors propagate structurally in project support pruning but become compiler `panic!` calls at four project/test-project assembly sites. | Item 12 | Use one checked compiler-diagnostic propagation contract for support-layout invariant failures. |
| Item 10A exact-SHA review | An identity-less class whose name matches a builtin error still resolves through the canonical builtin path; the identity-presence invariant is not asserted at lookup. | Item 12 | Enforce or diagnose the project-union nominal identity invariant without changing valid builtin lookup. |
| Item 10A merge gate | The sole gate passed every reached Item 10A guardrail and the Rust-interop area, then stopped on the unchanged unclassified SQL packages/targets and stale SQL milestone taxonomy already owned by Item 12. | Item 12 | Reconcile coverage/profile taxonomy and prove every current SQL package and target is classified before final qualification. |
| Item 11 merge gate | The sole gate on reviewed candidate `78c28c1e4c42bd85d685d3a3cffdf132fcdfcc40` found 15 stale generated demo companions after Cargo cache setup, HIR, and file-size checks passed. | Item 11A | Integrate the reviewed Item 11 candidate, regenerate the 15 named companions through the compiler, prove `scripts/check_demo_emitted_freshness.py`, and use Item 11A's separately bounded review and gate without rerunning Item 11's gate. |
| Item 11A exact-SHA review | `replacement_or_split_limit` duplicates the string receiver expression while computing its length, which is harmless for current literal companions but can re-evaluate an expensive or side-effecting receiver in the already-accepted Item 11 mechanism. | Item 12 | Bind the receiver once before count/limit conversion and add semantic coverage for a nontrivial receiver without reopening Item 11A's generated-companion-only scope. |
| Item 11A merge gate | The sole gate passed every reached Item 11A guardrail and all 10 Rust-interop variants, then stopped on the unchanged unclassified SQL packages/targets and stale SQL milestone taxonomy already owned by Item 12. | Item 12 | Reconcile coverage/profile taxonomy and prove every current SQL package and target is classified before final qualification. |

  `expect_used`) are not passing qualification receipts.
  The sole exact-clean-SHA merge gate failed after 184.65s on existing SQL
  coverage classifications: 9 packages, 13 targets, 1 stale PostgreSQL target.
  Generated-companion freshness, reached guards, Rust interop (10/10), and the
  other 3 coverage variants passed. Later Python-area/crate/E2E gate stages
  were not reached. No create-PR gate, second merge gate, or bypass was used.
  Evidence and deferred maintenance 12I-F1–F3 are recorded in the
  [Python dependency owner](ad-hoc-python-interop-qualification-dependencies.md#item12i-terminal-handoff-2026-09-06)
  and `/private/tmp/sifr-item12i.0l85Lu/evidence-f6e8afd964bb214a44c50271dcb2014ee8e828b4.md`.
  Parent and preserved12B/12H workers remain untouched;12H remains unmerged
  with exhausted review/gate allowances. This session stops after its record
  update; no12J/12K code is written. 12K owns eventual integrated qualification
  after remaining dependencies, not this worker.

- Items 11 and 11A are merged through [PR #3689](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3689)
  as `bbc85bcd3e538e201f7f82fa535c7cef43a5ac6e`; exact candidate
  `ec380f0b221d65516516291018008434c1c1e62a` preserved reviewed Item 11
  candidate `78c28c1e4c42bd85d685d3a3cffdf132fcdfcc40`, regenerated exactly the
  15 stale companions through that compiler, passed exact freshness and agent
  review, and passed every reached item-owned check in its sole merge-profile
  gate. Closed draft [#3687](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3687) is
  superseded, and Item 11's consumed gate was not rerun. Item 12 owns `anext`
  mutation fidelity, conservative `mut` cleanup, checked-read condition
  fidelity, literal-typed comparison specialization, generated
  `missing_const_for_fn` debt, final fixture-root hygiene, checked
  support-layout propagation, identity-presence enforcement, single-evaluation
  string receiver lowering, and the unchanged SQL coverage/taxonomy gate
  failures.
- Item 12 is in progress on `codex/emitted-rust-excellence-item-12`.
  Recovery commits `4bc460de6a176c23d0faf6cb5a3686cb5846a3cc` and
  `40faa5ea3221e96a7cc2064d8c5787aded76c96e` remain preserved.
  Candidate `05d9049db150901a5bdba07ce169a7874fdcd21d` preserves the first
  replacement-worker repair batch. None of these commits is closure evidence.
  The replacement worker adopted all existing compiler and generated-output work.
  The latest unit run passes 1,458 codegen tests in
  `target/item12-statement-entry-unit-tests.log`.
  The unchanged runtime passes 90 unit tests and nine exact-integer integration
  tests in `target/item12-completion-all-units.log` and
  `target/item12-owned-integer-native.log`.
  This is partial working-tree evidence, not full exact-SHA qualification.
  Strict SQL classification, taxonomy, profile self-tests, provider checks,
  HIR, and file-size checks pass. Stdlib governance passes four variants.
  Repairs preserve empty-vector types, compatible collection element types,
  error-carrier transfers, lexical shadows, constructor and callback ABIs,
  and single-evaluation receivers. The native repetition regression passed
  after its typed-empty-list repair. Its fixture now also tests unused
  projections with effectful receivers and retained closure captures.
  Final API normalization now reapplies lexical borrow facts.
  Project analysis retains declared module paths and imported alias identities.
  Typed cleanup replaces the adopted basename-based string rewrite.
  Negative tests preserve unknown callees, string callbacks, scalar trait
  methods, and same-named project functions with different contracts.
  All 262 companions regenerated with that compiler.
  Project-mode audit checks pass in
  `target/item12-qualified-type-project-modes.json`.
  The latest complete 91-project Clippy audit has no compiler errors.
  It retains 37 diagnostics: nine unused underscore bindings, 27 redundant
  clones, and one unnecessary lazy fallback.
  Evidence is `target/sifr_generated_code_quality/clippy-1788599904-22328/clippy-summary.json`.
  The current repair removes unused source string projections before cloning,
  limits loop moves to proven terminal paths, and makes typed `None`
  fallbacks eager. New tests cover captures, effectful receivers, labeled
  repetition, and lookalike methods.
  Module, method, and nested statement emission now consume the same cached projection
  plan. Effectful receivers still execute. Workspace Clippy passes in
  `target/item12-statement-entry-clippy.log`. Native regression execution passes in
  `target/item12-statement-entry-native.log`. All 262 companions are fresh in
  `target/item12-statement-entry-regeneration.log`.
  The earlier audit `clippy-1788593723-99038` and stopped companion run
  `companions-1788594004-8716` are historical failures, not current qualification.
  Earlier E2E and algorithmic runs were stopped after a native ABI failure.
  Their partial output is not passing evidence.
  The compiler is frozen for qualification. Full qualification, review, and
  the sole merge gate remain.
  Item 12A remains closure-only and receives the sole whole-phase review.
- The current user instruction supersedes the older gate ordering above:
  skip create-PR when this session will merge the reviewed SHA; run one
  merge-profile gate on the final implementation SHA and never repeat it.
  No Item 12 exact-SHA Opus review or merge-profile gate has been consumed.
- No whole-phase review has been consumed.
- Current qualification checkpoint: `8ad089a9458f35fcfa228e93fe44f4d69731828b`
  is committed and pushed. No implementation PR exists. No Item 12 review or
  merge-profile gate was consumed. This candidate is not qualified or merged.
  The frozen compiler is `/tmp/sifr-item12-qualified.l0Kpiu/sifr`, with SHA-256
  `06a596d406f5a174a9a6ace72bc6d15919e6e3af5727578a46819479210c8c39`.
- Exact-candidate full stdlib parity passes in
  `target/item12-8ad089a94-stdlib-full.json`. Project-mode checks pass in
  `target/item12-8ad089a94-project-modes.json`. Full-surface inventory passes in
  `target/sifr_generated_code_quality/evidence/inventory-1788602855-3923.json`.
- The partial companion audit retains 52 diagnostic pairs and 30 diagnostics:
  25 `needless_pass_by_value`, three `redundant_clone`, and two `implicit_clone`.
  Raw evidence is under
  `target/sifr_generated_code_quality/companions-1788602855-5663/diagnostics/`.
  These findings remain Item 12-owned producer work, not an external blocker.
  This partial audit does not replace the earlier complete 91-project audit.
- Full algorithmic qualification found source-contract failures in the separately
  owned `sifr-lang/leetcode` submodule. Its pinned commit is
  `ad116aa8dcae51b7db1bdf0052470456d671d31b`, unchanged from the Item 12 base.
  The median fixture omits conversion-error handling. The zigzag fixture omits
  index-error handling. Upstream `main` has the same file tree.
  The [owning issue](ad-hoc-algorithmic-full-corpus-preexisting-failures.md#2026-09-05-emitted-rust-item-12-qualification-blocker)
  records the exact diagnostics and evidence paths.
- The worker stopped only its qualification process trees after it confirmed
  the external blocker. The partial algorithmic run reports 13 failures among
  63 completed checks. The full generated-quality and E2E runs also stopped.
  Their logs remain under `target/item12-8ad089a94-*.log`.
  None of these interrupted runs is passing qualification evidence.
  The worker changed no external corpus files, acceptance rules, or Item 12A code.
- Next action: obtain the external corpus owner's source-contract remediation
  or explicit authority for separate corpus work. After that dependency clears,
  finish the retained Item 12 producer diagnostics and qualify the final compiler.
  Then perform the unused exact-SHA review and single merge-profile gate.

## Naming cleanup validation findings (2026-09-05)

The repository naming cleanup changes test names, demo paths, comments, and
verification metadata. It does not change list-repetition lowering. The full
codegen unit suite reports 1,406 passing tests and these two failures in
unchanged tests and implementation:

- `lib_codegen_tests::collections_and_stdlib_codegen_tests::test_list_repeat_lowers_without_vec_mul_shape`
- `lib_codegen_tests::performance_codegen_tests::single_element_list_repeat_uses_std_repeat_not_extend_loop`

Both expect `std::iter::repeat(SifrInt::from_i64(0))`; current emission uses an
explicit loop that extends the output from the repeated source list. These
failures remain owned by this emitted-Rust quality issue. Local evidence:
`target/naming-cleanup/codegen-tests.log`.

The full emitted-Rust audit validator also rejects the existing `ERQ-032`
current-source anchor in `crates/sifr_codegen/src/methods/list.rs`: its recorded
`exact_int_to_usize_expr` argument expression is absent. The naming cleanup
preserves this anchor and its enforcement. The new ownership schema passes the
validator mutation suite when that unrelated anchor is replaced by a valid
metric in an in-memory test copy. Local evidence:
`target/naming-cleanup/audit-tests.log`.

The full 92-program Clippy corpus also blocks quality-signature migration.
Restoring every pre-rename corpus identity in the captured diagnostics still
fails the original exact baseline (`selection-54c4863d30438d64`). The mismatch
therefore exceeds an identity-only rename. The run reports unowned
`clippy::missing_const_for_fn`, `clippy::redundant_pub_crate`,
`clippy::wildcard_imports`, `dead_code`, and `unused_imports`; its existing lint
counts and signatures also drift. Evidence:
`target/naming-cleanup/corpus-clippy.log`,
`target/naming-cleanup/clippy-diagnostics.json`, and
`target/naming-cleanup/quality-blocker.json`.

No lint allowance, owner exception, or diagnostic signature was refreshed to
accept that drift. Selection IDs and source-path inventory fingerprints were
migrated to the descriptive names; the exact diagnostic-signature migration
remains blocked. The independent full companion Clippy run was stopped when
this blocker was established. All 261 checked-in emitted companions had
already passed the complete freshness check. Resume the signature migration
only after this issue restores the authoritative quality baseline, then run
the required final gates for the completed candidate.

The cleanup invoked `scripts/run_all_tests.sh` once. It exited with a failure
in coverage-matrix readiness because SQL Cargo packages and test targets lack
classification (plus one stale PostgreSQL library-target classification).
Cargo cache setup, HIR, file-size, full demo freshness, Rust interop checks,
and taxonomy passed. The SQL blocker is recorded in
`plans/issues/active/ad-hoc-schema-first-sql-platform-review-follow-ups.md`.
This is not passing merge evidence. Log: `target/naming-cleanup/merge-gate.log`.

Cleanup-specific checks passed: taxonomy and mutation tests, surface inventory
and mutation tests, quality ownership/completion mutation tests, Rust interop
matrix/support checks, SQL qualification mutations, compatibility checks,
regression metadata, all 261 emitted companion freshness checks, all three
changed compact diagnostic outputs and their metadata coverage, the two
renamed E2E fixtures, the portable generated-project E2E test, four driver
portability tests, two driver error-identity tests, the process-argument stdlib
test, formatting, shell syntax, file-size and HIR guardrails, and diff checks.
All 534 edited Sifr source files retain their non-comment content, and every
fixture expectation remains in its original order.

## Demo directory follow-up (2026-09-05)

The three remaining standalone Sifr demos now have `main.sifr`, `emitted.rs`,
and `idiomatic.rs` companions. Their Sifr sources are byte-identical to the
previous commit. The companion inventory now contains 264 programs. Its
Clippy selection identifier changed to `selection-ee7a2285bedf4da8`; existing
debt counts and signatures were preserved. The quality-baseline reconciliation
described above must cover this expanded selection.

All three idiomatic references compiled and ran. The dependency-plan and typed
compiler-boundary Sifr demos also ran. Native execution of the runtime
observability demo fails with `SIFR-BUILD-0005` / Rust `E0433`: the generated
Cargo project does not enable `sifr_stdlib`'s `runtime-observability` feature.
The same failure reproduces with the original source from commit `79e04636d`.
This issue owns the generated-project dependency-feature correction; no
compiler or feature-selection workaround was added during the directory move.
Evidence: `target/demo-layout/runtime_observability_boundary.log` and
`target/demo-layout/original-runtime.log`.

## Abbreviated-label cleanup validation (2026-09-05)

The naming follow-up replaced opaque sysroot fixture module names, the mapped
token label in the structural bridge fixture and its expected output, and an
environment-test key. Six sysroot interop unit tests and the environment E2E
fixture passed. The taxonomy check now rejects abbreviated delivery labels in
paths, identifiers, metadata, and comments while preserving technical uses
such as percentile metrics, point variables, math functions, and migration IDs.

The ignored `test_build_structural_bridge_runtime` integration test fails before
compilation because `cargo metadata --locked --offline` rejects the copied
fixture's lockfile. Replacing the copied Sifr source with its original bytes
from `d1fb93d46` reproduces the same metadata failure. This issue owns restoring
the generated-project integration evidence; no fixture lockfile or dependency
was changed during naming cleanup. Evidence:
`target/abbreviation-cleanup/structural-runtime.log` and
`target/abbreviation-cleanup/original-structural-metadata.log`.

## Naming cleanup review remediation (2026-09-05)

The newly enrolled runtime-observability companion failed to build because
dependency pruning compared the Cargo feature `runtime-observability` with
the Rust namespace `runtime_observability`. The compiler now normalizes
hyphenated feature names before matching generated paths. A regression test
checks retention of runtime demand, rejection of unrelated JSON demand, and
pruning when the generated paths disappear. All four dependency-metadata
tests passed, and `demos/runtime_observability_boundary/main.sifr` built and
ran successfully. Astra high reviewed this fix without actionable findings.

The identity-dependent Clippy signature migration remains blocked by this
issue's pre-existing baseline provenance gap. The tracked baseline stores
aggregate hashes rather than their contributing per-entry diagnostics. Its
`baseline_commit` predates later aggregate updates. Replaying the historical
compiler and fixtures at `6ab6adc08` and the earlier complexity fixture at
`59b8a6e8` did not reproduce all old aggregates. Matching historical sysroots
also did not recover the baseline. Existing run evidence in other local
worktrees was inspected read-only; none matched the required aggregates.

An identity-only migration must first reproduce the old aggregates exactly
from original per-entry records. It must then apply renames and duplicate
consolidation, account separately for the three added companions, and
recompute selection IDs and diagnostic signatures together. Replacing the
baseline with current or reconstructed diagnostics would also accept
unrelated compiler drift. No such baseline refresh or lint allowance was
made. An experimental consistency validator was removed because requiring
unavailable baseline evidence would leave the repository's loader broken.

The three added companions emitted unchanged Rust and compiled through
Clippy without Rust compilation errors after binding their temporary Cargo
manifests to the local runtime and standard-library crates. They exposed
76 lint diagnostics; this is not a passing strict-Clippy gate or accepted
debt. Their unmodified exported manifests reference this unpublished
branch revision through Git, which prevented dependency resolution.
Final qualification owns that separate materialization/gate integration
problem. Evidence is under `target/review-remediation/`, including
`dependency-tests.log`, `observability-run.log`,
`new-companion-diagnostics.json`, `historical-complexity.log`, and
`rebound-companions.log`.

The remediation's sole merge gate passed all 264 emitted-companion freshness
checks, HIR and file-size guardrails, formatting, Rust interop, and naming
checks. It then stopped on the unchanged SQL coverage classifications owned
by `ad-hoc-schema-first-sql-platform-review-follow-ups.md`. This is not
passing merge evidence. Log: `target/review-remediation/merge-gate.log`.

## Naming cleanup PR qualification (2026-09-05)

PR [#3692](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3692) contains the cleanup
and runtime feature fix. Final CLI validation with
`cargo test -p sifr -- --skip test_e2e_pass` passed: 172 tests, no failures,
seven ignored tests, and the explicitly excluded positive E2E suite. This
includes the negative/runtime-failure E2E suites, emission panic-shape scan,
portable dependency-plan checks, and Python, host-tool, runtime-observability,
and sysroot integration tests. Log: `target/pr-cleanup/cli-tests.log`.

The create-PR gate passed all 264 companion freshness checks and reached
guardrails, then reproduced the existing SQL coverage classification
failures. Its log is `target/pr-cleanup/create-pr.log`; the previously recorded
merge gate applies to the same implementation. GitHub Actions also rejects
the unchanged workflow before starting any jobs: the same failure occurs
on base `2af89e75e` in
[run 33963698543](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/actions/runs/33963698543).
Final qualification owns the workflow repair. The diagnostic-baseline
identity migration and pre-existing quality failures described above remain
unresolved; these passing CLI results do not qualify the Clippy baseline.

## Item12K-B3 owned authorization and test registration (2026-09-06)

This worker owns only diagnostics schema synchronization, issue
[#3705](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3705), OPEN at dispatch.
The parent supplied the newer “Item12K-B2 receipt and B3 dispatch” and
preceding B1/B2 receipt; this registration carries that authorization into
this independent phase record before implementation. Owned checkout:
`/private/tmp/sifr-item12kb3.bEfGLS/sifr`, branch
`codex/item12k-b3-schema-sync`, fetched main/base
`770f1ab86050bc95abf05573b39c8c6d5238902e` (merged B2 PR #3706).
Parent's two intentional dirty Markdown files and all predecessor checkouts,
Git indexes, targets, and histories remain read-only. No inherited 12K stack
is imported or approved by B3.

Predecessor receipts:

- B1 reviewed two assertions only at
  `a42545f759fac4e5e0537b6f9d9cc2fb8c9ed233`; record
  `d7c41463ca88d5993e3bc3fa847806160799e147`, PR #3702 unmerged.
  Its [exact gate receipt](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3702#issuecomment-5558641648)
  records one failed 3254.32-second gate, Python 30/30, diagnostic baselines
  179/179, diagnostics overall 182/184. Matcher B2 and schema B3 failed;
  subsequent stages were unreached. No B1 retry is authorized.
- B2 PR #3706 reviewed `8be5b9ece92703fda44149bb79ec6ed077e23c10`,
  merged at this base; record `a53b5d34f6a7a659e39d66c0c0d6d9397c8b2216`.
  [Receipt](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3704#issuecomment-5558722496):
  11 focused passes, canonical coverage, syntax/file-size checks, one
  SATISFIED review, zero remediation/gates. #3707/#3708 are separate owners.
- Original 12K candidate `7e23785ab07cba6f925eed2f934c0304750f1d74`
  and corpus `8bcbe7ab7939e5c8362c10f61a80e368022cc372` stay preserved;
  original 12K has zero reviews/gates used, with dependency caps unchanged.

First capture the locked generator stdout and establish the exact source,
artifact, and dependency mechanism; this is diagnosis, not a test pass.
Complete the bounded root-cause correction before testing, preserving the
intended public schema and strict comparison. No blind blessing, ignored
field-order/value differences, fallback, or unrelated dependency upgrades.
Necessary focused regressions are in scope; register their exact command
before running them. Use apply_patch for edits or the normal generator when
supported by the diagnosis. Do not overwrite the artifact through a shell
redirect. Normal scoped push/draft PR/merge, owner updates, and read-only
Claude execution are authorized.

Named validation, executed from the owned checkout after implementation:

- `cargo run --locked -q -p sifr_diagnostics --bin gen-diagnostic-schema`
  (stdout capture under `/private/tmp/sifr-item12kb3.bEfGLS/`, also authorized
  before implementation solely for diagnosis).
- `python3 verification/areas/diagnostics/checks/schema_sync.py`.
- `cargo test -p sifr_diagnostics`.
- `uv run --project verification --locked python -m sifr_verify areas run --area diagnostics --result-json /private/tmp/sifr-item12kb3.bEfGLS/sifr/target/verification/areas/diagnostics-b3-results.json`.
  Require the full 179 baseline variants and five rules; no partial
  certification or coverage bypass. Report actual coverage.
- `python3 scripts/check_file_size_guardrails.py`.
- Relevant JSON parsing, Python syntax, Markdown/diff checks, and
  `git diff --check`. If Rust source changes also `cargo fmt --check` and
  `python3 scripts/check_hir_maintainability_guardrails.py`.

One initial exact-SHA Opus review and at most one remediation; prompt includes
base/candidate/paths/scope/evidence, read-only, no invented requirements or
repeated broad validation. Atomic completed response outside reviewed tree;
at most three failed transport attempts, never three review rounds. A second
review's new mechanism defect gets a later owner and terminal stop. Compiler,
lockfile, fixture, and workflow unchanged means zero Sifr gates even if the
schema artifact changes. If governed inputs necessarily change, run exactly
one merge-profile gate on the approved final SHA, skip create-pr, no second
gate. Reuse exact-input evidence. Check free space before long Cargo work;
only clean this worker's unused private target if over 20 GiB. External
failures receive owner records and terminal stop, not unrelated repairs.

After B3 merge and documentation-only phase receipt, stop without further
review/gates. Do not resume 12K or start 12D/E/F, Item12, or phase closure.
Return item ID, PR, reviewed implementation/record/merge SHAs, exact test,
review and gate counts, evidence links, changed paths, and blocker or none.

### B3 diagnosis and focused-test registration

Read-only diagnosis established that commit
`066300ff185f38b425a884a2225b72990a194e58` removed workspace
`serde_json/preserve_order` without updating the schema last written in
`5f6019eeb9`. Locked package generation uses schemars 1.2.2 and serde_json
1.0.151 without preserve_order. Schemars orders schema keywords explicitly,
while the eight properties/definitions maps follow serde_json map order.
The old artifact uses insertion order, the current generator lexical order.
Recursive comparison found identical keys, values, and array order everywhere;
only eight object key orders differ. This comparison classifies the defect;
it does not replace strict synchronization validation.

Diagnostic captures under the owned root (not counted as test passes):

- `schema-before.json`, current locked generator, SHA256
  `ebc73fd29b44df16e14ac636437d9f93b67088925a8a381b90b2fde7e72b83a3`.
- `schema-preserve-order.json`, the same command with
  `--features serde_json/preserve_order`, SHA256
  `0af2f7f3e6c438bff56767af14dde31b18f2d1fd2b9b6e833a1300463d4f976a`,
  byte-identical to the old tracked artifact. This controlled feature change
  establishes cause without upgrading dependencies or changing source.
- The first capture attempt could not build before this fresh checkout's
  Ruff submodule was initialized; no generator executed on that attempt.
  Owned Ruff is pinned at `f19957111640fdee8055bfe5b6aa854259344473`.

B3 base and historical main `4ce05473f58716a611ac190581bf0737ba15331e`
have identical Cargo.toml/lock, diagnostics/source crates, Ruff pin and Cargo
config. Diagnostics tree `47f22e0bd83633bd650a9826fdc3a69d3078ded7`,
schema blob `6c2e5a625970d4f0e23c02317375ac09c3b3639e`, checker blob
`cbf87fa8f7b3fa916504820b2a6622868054aae3` match B1. B1's Cargo.lock
diff adds only the lowering insta edge; no inherited integration evidence is
used to certify this independently built candidate.

Correction: update only the artifact's proven stale ordering with the captured
normal generator output through apply_patch; retain the current dependency
policy and model. Add `--locked` to the strict checker's generator command.
Register `python3 -m unittest discover -s verification/areas/diagnostics/checks -p 'test_schema_sync.py' -v`
before adding/running focused regressions for exact agreement, changed object
order, values, array order, formatting, missing artifact and generator failure.
JSON/Python syntax check registration:
`python3 -m json.tool docs/schemas/diagnostics.schema.json` and
`python3 -m py_compile verification/areas/diagnostics/checks/schema_sync.py verification/areas/diagnostics/checks/test_schema_sync.py`.
No Rust/compiler, lockfile, fixture or workflow changes are necessary, so
Sifr gate count is zero under the explicit dispatch rule.

### B3 validation invocation correction

Implementation commit `226b489981d1adeed1691c1f2354d67ed608dd21` passed
locked generator comparison, direct schema synchronization, all seven focused
regressions, all 32 diagnostics crate tests, file-size (3756 files), JSON/Python
syntax and diff checks. The first full-area invocation emitted pass for all
179 baseline variants and all five rules, then exited 1 because this worker
had registered `/private/tmp/sifr-item12kb3.bEfGLS/diagnostics-results.json`,
outside the runner's permitted repository root. No result JSON was written.
This is an owned invocation mistake, not a compiler/schema failure or a
successful full-area command. Preserve `diagnostics-area-226b48998.log` as
the exact failed-invocation evidence; do not synthesize a passing report.

Before the corrected invocation, the registered command above now places its
result under this owned checkout's `target/verification/areas/`. No compiler,
checker, schema, test, dependency, fixture or workflow inputs changed. Reuse
the other passing targeted evidence across this documentation-only correction;
repeat the named complete area once to obtain its canonical successful report.
No Sifr gate has run and no gate retry is involved. B3 reviews remain zero.

### Item12K-B3 terminal receipt: merged (2026-09-06)

  `b53ac2f7674eb2d49f2818894be1da16c6f244f9`; direct tree diff is empty.
- Owned checkout `/private/tmp/sifr-item12kb3.bEfGLS/sifr`, branch
  `codex/item12k-b3-schema-sync`. This post-merge commit is a documentation-only
  terminal record; its SHA is published in the owner/PR terminal receipt.
- [Validation receipt](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3709#issuecomment-5558941208).
  Locked generator/artifact bytes and direct schema-sync check pass;
  32 diagnostics crate tests and seven focused checker regressions pass;
  file-size guard (3756 files), JSON/Python syntax and diff checks pass.
- Corrected complete diagnostics-area invocation exits 0: **184/184** variants,
  **179/179** baselines across 151 cases and **5/5** rules; zero failures,
  skipped or filtered variants. Full-area invocation count is **two**:
  the first emitted all 184 passes but exited 1 without a report because of
  this worker's invalid output path, then the corrected full run passed and
  wrote its canonical report. The first invocation is not counted as a
  successful area command. No report was synthesized and no partial
  certification substituted for the full successful run.
- [One initial Opus review](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3709#issuecomment-5558960888):
  **SATISFIED**, no blockers, exact final candidate. **Zero remediation**
  reviews and **zero failed review requests**. Review stayed outside the
  reviewed tree. No further review is required for this record-only update.
- **Zero create-pr gates, zero merge gates**. No Rust/compiler, lockfile,
  fixture or workflow files changed, so the explicit B3 dispatch excludes
  Sifr gates and conditional Rust fmt/HIR checks. No whole-phase review.

Changed paths relative to base are exactly:

- `docs/schemas/diagnostics.schema.json` (eight proven stale object key orders;
  all schema keys, values, and array order preserved).
- `verification/areas/diagnostics/checks/schema_sync.py` (locked generator
  invocation; full strict comparison retained).
- `verification/areas/diagnostics/checks/test_schema_sync.py` (seven regressions).
- `plans/issues/active/ad-hoc-emitted-rust-excellence.md` (B3 records only).

Nonblocking Opus follow-ups are separately owned:
[#3710](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3710), automatic discovery of
focused diagnostics checker regressions; and
[#3711](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3711), feature-independent
schema ordering (including the associated canonicalization suggestion).
No follow-up implementation was started. #3707/#3708 remain separate owners.

Blocker: **none**. Parent's two intentional dirty Markdown documents and all
predecessor checkouts/indexes/targets/histories remain preserved read-only.
This narrow merge does not approve or import the inherited 12K stack. Original
12K remains at zero reviews and zero gates used, with all dependency caps
unchanged. Exact next action for this worker: stop after publishing this
terminal record. Any 12K continuation, 12D/E/F, Item12 or closure work belongs
to a fresh separately authorized worker; none is started here.

## Descriptive demo variables follow-up (2026-09-05)

A second pass found no delivery-labelled `m12` path or content under `demos`,
but found ambiguous numbered variable names in 12 demos and `m12` among the
regex fixture's match results. Those variables now use semantic names.
Affected emitted companions were regenerated and four idiomatic references
were updated. Token comparison confirms that all 13 changed Sifr files
contain identifier-only edits. No filename, fixture order, assertion, or
expected output changed. The taxonomy guard now rejects abbreviated numbered
variable declarations in demo Sifr and Rust files, including underscore
prefixes, while retaining percentile and command-option exceptions.

All 12 demos, the regex fixture, and the four edited idiomatic references
built and ran successfully. Taxonomy mutation tests, the active-surface
scan, and file-size checks passed. The final merge gate passed all 264
companion freshness checks and reached guardrails, then reproduced the
existing SQL coverage-classification blocker. Logs are under
`target/demo-name-followup/`. Existing Clippy baseline debt and its unresolved
migration were not refreshed.

### 2026-09-06 Item12J-M1 orchestration scope

The 12J-R1 worker is closed. Draft PR #3699 preserves implementation
`4bc432f3474134b1a1d43202d39fd147893bb014` and record
`c430ed3331169f06eb148122f681e7d2a457d2ee` in
`/private/tmp/sifr-item12j-r1.9j9Uhf/sifr`. Its terminal evidence and the
separate Item12J-M1 mechanism are recorded in that commit's Python dependency
issue. Nine focused and 587 driver tests pass, but the second review is
NOT SATISFIED. Neither 12J nor R1 is qualified; no gate or merge occurred.

Assign one fresh worker to 12J-M1, before integration. Its dependencies are the
preserved candidate, both review findings, and the existing nominal error
language/representation contract. First establish that contract from repository
authorities. Then repair the distinct message-storage and conversion-demand
mechanism: an unrelated root Error reference must not generate invalid unused
conversions for specific errors; legitimate root upcasts must have sound native
representations. Cover absent, integer, own-string and inherited message storage,
with specific and root channels, local/imported identities and project modes.
Preserve previously valid specific-error programs. Do not invent a message
fallback, silently narrow accepted language, or weaken fixtures. If the existing
contract cannot decide a necessary language behavior, return needs-new-scope
with the precise user choice before implementing that policy.

This is a separately bounded mechanism item under the user's instruction to
record second-review defects as later work. It does not reopen 12J/R1 for a
third review or waive the repeated, unresolved conversion obligation. M1 has
one initial exact-SHA review and at most one remediation review, limited to
this contract/mechanism and its interactions, and one final-candidate merge
gate if approval and prerequisite qualification permit. Preserve every prior
failed review/gate and do not present a changed scope as approval of old code.

Named validation: `cargo test -p sifr_driver async_python_error_channel`,
`cargo test -p sifr_codegen`, `cargo test -p sifr_driver`,
`cargo build --locked -p sifr`, demo freshness update/check with that compiler,
the original `async-declaration-examples` and `async-context-examples` Python
interop command, `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings`, `cargo fmt --check`,
HIR and file-size guards, and the single `scripts/run_all_tests.sh --profile merge`.
Register focused named regressions before testing; reuse unchanged evidence.
If a frontend/lowering/IR change is necessary to this representation contract,
register its affected original Item12J crate test command before implementation.
Implement the complete bounded correction before testing. Keep 12I native
qualification, 12B/12C, SQL coverage, TypeVar #3667, and other follow-ups outside
this worker. Preserve an approved candidate for 12K if an external dependency
prevents standalone merge; never integrate an unapproved candidate as-is.

### Item12J-M1 contract adjudication handoff (2026-09-06)

State: **needs-new-scope; not implemented, not reviewed, not merged**.
The section above was copied verbatim from the parent's new orchestration
scope, preserving all historical records in retained record `c430ed3331169f06eb148122f681e7d2a457d2ee`.
This session owns the independent checkout `/private/tmp/sifr-item12j-m1.VO82Kk/sifr`
and branch `codex/emitted-rust-excellence-item-12j-m1`. It retains all original
12J/R1 commits. The parent and the two closed worker worktrees, indexes, targets,
and evidence were read only. Fetched latest main remains
`4ce05473f58716a611ac190581bf0737ba15331e`; there are no intervening base changes.
Draft [PR #3699](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3699) remains unapproved.

Repository contract evidence at the retained candidate:

- `internal_docs/architecture.md:762-769,829-864` says every error inherits
  `message: str`, supplied by a user error's constructor. `AppError(Error): pass`
  is documented as accepting a message. No absent-message initialization or
  integer-message root projection is specified.
- `docs/language/error-handling.mdx:31-46` describes custom errors as plain
  structs with typed fields; examples declare their own string message. It
  does not decide message-less upcasts.
- `crates/sifr_type_system/src/types/error_contracts.rs:9-24` recognizes root
  Error only with exactly one string `message`; codegen's
  `preamble/types_and_errors.rs:367-410` stores that string and requires it in
  `new`. Root storage cannot represent an absent message today.
- `crates/sifr_lowering/src/lower/descriptor_declarations.rs:341-350,460-465` treats
  Error as a special base, bypassing ordinary embedded-parent storage.
  `classes/class_type_collection.rs:304-309` retains an unimplemented comment
  promising message insertion; `:863-875` actually derives the default
  constructor from collected fields. This explains accepted `CodeError(3)`,
  `EmptyError()`, and integer `message` declarations without supplying a
  hidden root string.
- `crates/sifr_codegen/src/class_emitter.rs:460-475` can format a specific
  error's own message (including integers), or use Debug when absent. That
  existing Display rule does not say a root upcast must store this formatting
  as its message. Treating it as conversion policy would be a new decision,
  including for inherited/custom formatting.
- `error_refs/conversions.rs:99-130` and `preamble/error_conversion.rs:17-23`
  assume a field and string type that ancestry does not establish. Suppressing
  invalid unused impls alone leaves the accepted explicit root upcast broken.

The [R1 review](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3699#issuecomment-5556273003)
already supplies exact-binary evidence: the own-channel code-only example built
before R1 and now fails E0609 when unrelated code mentions Error; explicit
root upcasts check successfully but fail native E0277 before R1 / E0609 after.
Absent and integer message cases fail too. No additional compiler probe was run.

Required owner/user decision (none selected by this worker):

| Contract direction | Concrete behavior and tradeoff |
| --- | --- |
| Enforce inherited required string storage | Require a message in every error constructor and reject incompatible field overrides. This follows the documented architecture, but changes accepted `CodeError(3)`, `EmptyError()`, and `message: int` programs; explicit authorization must relax M1's preservation requirement. |
| Define root conversion from existing Display | Preserve specific constructors and define the root string for message-less/integer errors from their existing Display output, while retaining real string storage where present. Requires an explicit new conversion policy for own/inherited/custom formatting, allocation, and observable root messages; it is not authorized as a fallback. |
| Allow root errors without a string message | Preserve message-less structured payloads through a new root representation and define absent-message access/formatting and field collisions. This changes the root language/API contract and has substantially wider compiler/runtime/interop scope. |

Do not choose rejection, default text, blanket formatting, or a new root
representation implicitly. Resume only after the contract direction and its
scope adjustment are explicit. The complete correction, reaching regression
registration, named compiler/native validation, review, and gate are **unreached**.
M1 used zero Opus reviews and zero gates; old 12J's two NOT SATISFIED reviews
remain exhausted. No approved implementation SHA exists for M1.

### Item12J-M1 user adjudication and implementation registration (2026-09-06)

The user answered **"Do your recommendation through workers"** and explicitly
authorized enforcing the required constructor-supplied string message for every
error. The prior decision blocker is resolved: this supersedes preservation of
message-less constructor calls and integer message overrides, which must now be
rejected. History above remains evidence of the earlier unresolved decision.
No Display-derived fallback, absent-message root representation, test weakening,
or next-item implementation is authorized.

Implementation notes for this authorization: error storage is seeded and checked
in lowering, and both explicit and inherited constructors must have a required
string input and complete their storage initialization. Pure error children
forward the actual parent constructor; mixed non-error data parents retain their
physical layout. Canonical nominal identity drives consuming root conversions,
including projections through owned embedded parents, without Display fallback.
Imported `Error` shadows and constructor-only stdlib nominals are handled in
both project and test-project import ownership. These are directly necessary
collision/export paths, not general 12K integration.

The runtime's channel errors and the sync/parallel-map first-party callers now
supply explicit messages. The opaque-state negative fixture changes its payload
from representable `str` to unrepresentable `int`, preserving its original
diagnostic assertion and purpose under the new inherited message contract.
PythonError's native five-field assertion uses the existing package fixture's
probed interpreter/native-link trust; it is not skipped or weakened. File-size
splits isolate declaration diagnostics and project import binding ownership.

This sole implementer owns independent checkout
`/private/tmp/sifr-item12j-m1-required.vL5lSI/sifr`, branch
`codex/item12j-m1-required-string`, retaining record `054a823b9aaafd388ddf1d944f1b7e50fcb95c29`
and all original12J/R1 lineage. Parent and former workers' checkouts, indexes,
targets, and evidence are read-only. Parent orchestrates only.

Scope: consistent typed string storage; default/custom/inherited constructors;
declaration and call diagnostics; nominal identity and exports; consuming root
conversions. Preserve explicit string layouts including PythonError's exact
five fields with no duplicate message storage or extra parameter. Migrate
necessary first-party fixtures/demos/docs while preserving their purpose and
assertions. Mixed-marker ancestry or other deferred findings are included only
if directly necessary to this required-string contract, with explicit provenance.

Before testing, register focused `required_error_message` regressions in lowering
and driver for absent/integer/missing constructor diagnostics and positive
own/inherited/default/custom/local/imported/stdlib/collision/project/test-project
emission and native execution, including unused root-conversion demand and
explicit consuming upcasts. Commands: `cargo test -p sifr_lowering required_error_message`,
`cargo test -p sifr_driver required_error_message`, plus all named M1 commands:
`cargo test -p sifr_driver async_python_error_channel`, `cargo test -p sifr_codegen`,
`cargo test -p sifr_driver`, `cargo test -p sifr_ir`, `cargo test -p sifr_lowering`,
`cargo test -p sifr_frontend`, `cargo test -p sifr_type_system`,
`cargo build --locked -p sifr`,
`python3 scripts/check_demo_emitted_freshness.py --sifr target/debug/sifr --update`
then without `--update`,
`uv run --project verification --locked python -m sifr_verify areas run --area python_interop --suite async-declaration-examples --suite async-context-examples`,
`cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings`, `cargo fmt --check`,
`python3 scripts/check_hir_maintainability_guardrails.py`, and
`python3 scripts/check_file_size_guardrails.py`.
Finish bounded implementation before running tests, then iterate on in-scope
failures. Inspect disk/private target before long Cargo runs. One initial
exact-SHA Opus review and at most one remediation review remain unused, as does
one `scripts/run_all_tests.sh --profile merge` on the approved final candidate;
skip create-pr. A new second-review mechanism defect is later work and stops M1.
Prior12J/R1 reviews remain NOT SATISFIED and exhausted; no budget is reset.

12I cancellation-task-local native qualification, 12B codegen failures, 12C
Clippy, TypeVar #3667, and SQL coverage remain externally owned. Finish M1
before evaluating those blockers; preserve the corrected approved candidate
for12K if they prevent merge. No gate without approval and no second gate.
After merge/record, or an evidenced external block after correction/review,
return item, PR, reviewed SHA, record SHA, merge SHA or none, evidence/paths,
blocker or none and stop.

Directly necessary provenance: the earlier12J-F1 mixed data-parent/Error-marker
ancestry and12J-F4 imported parent named Error are included only where needed
to ensure an accepted error retains its required string storage and root
ancestry. Native regressions exercise both. Runtime channel producers and two
parallel-map callers now supply explicit messages; their behavior/assertions
are retained. Custom constructors that already compute an initialized string
(such as configparser's section errors) retain that source contract.
Fetched main remains `4ce05473f58716a611ac190581bf0737ba15331e`, with no base delta.
Disk before initial Cargo validation: 209 GiB free, no private target yet.

#### Historical 054a823b9 documentation-only receipt

Only the phase and Python dependency Markdown records change. Documentation
diff checking and the named file-size guard are recorded in external evidence
`/private/tmp/sifr-item12j-m1.VO82Kk/evidence.md`, which will identify the final
record SHA. Prior unchanged-input evidence remains historical evidence for
unapproved `4bc432f3474134b1a1d43202d39fd147893bb014`, not an M1 pass:
focused 9 / driver 587 pass; codegen two 12B failures; strict Clippy 12B/12C
failure; native async suites blocked by 12I E0425 with runtime assertions
unreached; lowering two #3667 failures. SQL and other integration dependencies
remain separately owned. No next item or integration work was started.

### Item12J-M1 terminal handoff (2026-09-06): approved, externally blocked

Status: **SATISFIED source review; not merged, not closed**. The user's required
constructor-supplied string decision is implemented; the old decision blocker is
resolved, not renewed. This terminal record supersedes the earlier needs-choice
status without changing any historical12J/R1 verdict or review/gate count.

- Implementation: `d726ffc11258c49f0185fd2d49697988cf90972c`.
- M1 delta base: `054a823b9aaafd388ddf1d944f1b7e50fcb95c29`, retaining all original12J/R1 lineage.
- Main remains `4ce05473f58716a611ac190581bf0737ba15331e`; no base integration occurred.
- Linked bounded draft [PR #3700](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3700),
  branch `codex/item12j-m1-required-string`. Predecessor #3699 remains preserved.
- Sole initial exact-SHA [Opus review](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3700#issuecomment-5558127599):
  **SATISFIED**, no blocking findings. One initial review used; zero remediation
  reviews, provider retries, create-PR gates, or merge gates used. No merge SHA.
- Owned independent checkout `/private/tmp/sifr-item12j-m1-required.vL5lSI/sifr`;
  parent and every retained worker checkout/index/target remained unchanged.
- SHA-keyed receipt and complete36-path inventory:
  `/private/tmp/sifr-item12j-m1-required.vL5lSI/evidence-d726ffc11258c49f0185fd2d49697988cf90972c.md`
  and sibling `changed-paths.txt`. The receipt identifies the final record SHA;
  this record-only commit does not change reviewed implementation inputs.

#### Exact-candidate evidence and external owner receipt

Final full driver passes **592 active /77 existing ignored**, including all five
M1 regressions. Focused lowering passes3, original async-error-channel tests pass9,
frontend passes132unit+7integration, IR passes4 and type-system147 with documented
unchanged complete-input reuse. The locked CLI build passes; compiler SHA256 is
`166c1d23662db3c0da97b9c921e6f7fee22755b68c49e576906e07a569eec16e` before and after
native verification. All264 demo companions are fresh after the named update
regenerated exactly `config_json_csv`, `stdlib`, and
`structured_parsing_serialization`. Formatting, HIR maintainability, and the
canonical900-line file guard pass (3764files). No test assertion or ignore policy
was weakened. All raw logs remain beside the SHA-keyed receipt.

Standalone merge is blocked by these externally owned named checks:

- **12B:** codegen1407pass/2known list-repeat assertion failures;
  `codegen-complete.log`, retained dependency PR #3694. No12B input was integrated.
- **12B/12C:** strict Clippy stops at the unchanged `expect_used` body in
  `project_stdlib_nominals.rs:47` (formerly45); `clippy-candidate.log`.
- **TypeVar [#3667](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3667):**
  lowering1117pass/2known stale diagnostic assertions/1existing ignored;
  `lowering-candidate.log`. The prior owner notification remains valid and was
  not duplicated or claimed resolved.
- **12I / Python qualification owner:** both original async native suites fail
  inaccessible cancellation-task-local E0425. Source policies pass; runtime
  assertions are **UNREACHED**, not passes or skips. HTTP reports1Rust error;
  context reports58 with the same retained diagnostic tail. `async-native.log`,
  `async-declaration.json`, `async-context.json`, and `python-results.json`
  preserve the reports. Retained12I PR #3698 was not integrated.
- SQL coverage remains an external historical dependency, not a newly run gate
  failure. No merge-profile gate was run over these failed prerequisites; its
  allowance is unused, not reset. No create-PR gate was run.

The new native local/project/test-project and canonical PythonError assertions
pass. They do not replace the externally blocked original async cleanup/runtime
qualification. Initial209GiBfree/no target and later187GiBfree/~20GiB private
target checks were recorded; the latter target was in use by owned validation.
No shared/former-worker target was cleaned or cold-cache performance claimed.

#### Separately owned Opus follow-ups (not started)

- **12J-M1-F1 — compiler invariant hardening:** replace the conversion storage
  walk's programmer-invariant panic with a compiler diagnostic if desired.
  Review found no source program violating lowering's invariant. This is a
  hardening suggestion, not a blocker or runtime fallback authorization.
- **12J-M1-F2 — reference-only inherited stdlib storage qualification:** determine
  whether an inherited error such as `sifr.sql.EncodeError` can reach codegen
  only as a type reference without its declaring HirClass. The pre-existing
  reference-only path still uses `err.message`; the reviewer did not establish
  reachability. Qualify in the SQL owner's scope; do not claim it fixed here.
- **12J-M1-F3 — integration validation coverage:** execute the migrated E2E and
  broader stdlib suites in the integration owner's authorized gate. M1 ran only
  the named commands; Opus's read-only first-party source audit found no remaining
  constructor migration, arity, required-string, or expected-output violation.
  Source audit is not executable-suite qualification.
- **12J-M1-F4 — architecture shadow clarification:** document explicitly that a
  same-module `class Error(Error)` shadow can be the data parent for subsequent
  classes. Native M1 coverage already exercises the necessary physical layout;
  the extra prose is a later documentation suggestion, not implemented here.

No remediation review, whole-phase review, second gate, third review, external
fix, or next-item code was started. Preserve this approved implementation for
the separately owned12K integration once dependency qualification clears. The
worker stops after publishing this record and its evidence; it does not start12K.

## Item12K owned integration authority (2026-09-06)

The following dispatch is copied from the intentional read-only parent document.
It controls this item; preceding status rows and dependency handoffs are historical.
This session is the sole live implementer, on an independent clone and Git index.

### 2026-09-05 orchestration amendment

The user approved fresh sequential workers for the Python dependencies, followed
by an integration worker, and authorized orchestration through phase closure.
Helmholtz is closed. Its candidates, review verdicts, and failed gates remain evidence.

- Execute 12G, 12H, 12I, and 12J in that order, with one live implementer.
  Each worker owns one isolated worktree and stops after merge or a concrete blocker.
- The [Python dependency issue](ad-hoc-python-interop-qualification-dependencies.md)
  defines their scope, dependencies, and named validation.
- Preserve Item 12B candidate `a3198ab9f936986b5ca1f9ce3fa73d36ac9ab74d`
  and corpus candidate `8bcbe7ab7939e5c8362c10f61a80e368022cc372`.
  Do not merge an unqualified dependency to bypass the other known failures.
- Item 12K receives one new integration review, at most one remediation review,
  and one exact-candidate merge-profile gate after dependency qualification.
  This is an explicit new integration allowance approved with the new work plan.
  It does not reopen Item 12B for a third review or relabel either failed gate.
- Integration review covers the new dependency changes and their interactions.
  Reuse the prior approved item evidence where implementation inputs are unchanged.
- If dependencies cannot merge independently because they share a failing gate,
  preserve their qualified candidates and record the dependency. The integration
  worker must establish passing evidence before any affected integration merge.
- After 12K, reconcile the recorded 12D, 12E, and 12F findings against merged
  evidence. Delegate unresolved work and remaining Item 12 scope sequentially.
  Do not treat a historical status row as proof that a finding is resolved.
- Assign the docs-only Item 12A closer only after every implementation item merges.
  Only that closer performs the whole-phase Opus review.
- Parent performs orchestration and record updates only, not implementation,
  tests, code review, or Sifr gates. User authorization covers the next phase actions.

### 2026-09-06 dependency handoff and bounded remediation

12G is merged (PRs #3695/#3696). 12H and 12I are approved but unmerged
candidates in draft PRs #3697/#3698; their sole gates failed externally owned
SQL coverage classifications. Their complete handoffs and deferred findings
remain in record commits `b6e6210a97598fb631b929b2d4daf4012b41bb16` and
`19ad69969a672d7b741122ded4dd879f2bdaf9ab`.

12J is unapproved, not merged: draft PR #3699, implementation
`f720a342edd87004975355b478948f7eb5c8b406`, record
`60219b080eadb519a813d9a84568552824be0754`. Its initial review found missing
non-builtin error conversions (12J-R1); native async validation also depends
on 12I. The original worker is closed. Assign a fresh worker to 12J-R1 before
12K. This is the remaining remediation of 12J, not a new initial-review cycle.

12J-R1 scope: connect semantic error ancestry to conversion demand for local,
project-imported and stdlib errors, preserving nominal identity and the original
runtime/error contract. Dependencies are the preserved 12J candidate and its
initial review; 12I remains a separate native qualification dependency.
Use the exact named validation in the Python owner issue at record `60219b0`,
including `cargo test -p sifr_driver async_python_error_channel` and the
`async-declaration-examples`/`async-context-examples` suites. Register focused
emission/compilation regressions before testing. Finish this in-scope correction
without absorbing known external failures. At most one remediation review and
one final-candidate merge gate remain for 12J; no third review or budget reset.
If external qualification still blocks merge, preserve the corrected reviewed
candidate for 12K. New second-review mechanism defects become later bounded
items. Do not integrate the unapproved 12J candidate as-is.

### 2026-09-06 Item12J-M1 orchestration scope

The 12J-R1 worker is closed. Draft PR #3699 preserves implementation
`4bc432f3474134b1a1d43202d39fd147893bb014` and record
`c430ed3331169f06eb148122f681e7d2a457d2ee` in
`/private/tmp/sifr-item12j-r1.9j9Uhf/sifr`. Its terminal evidence and the
separate Item12J-M1 mechanism are recorded in that commit's Python dependency
issue. Nine focused and 587 driver tests pass, but the second review is
NOT SATISFIED. Neither 12J nor R1 is qualified; no gate or merge occurred.

Assign one fresh worker to 12J-M1, before integration. Its dependencies are the
preserved candidate, both review findings, and the existing nominal error
language/representation contract. First establish that contract from repository
authorities. Then repair the distinct message-storage and conversion-demand
mechanism: an unrelated root Error reference must not generate invalid unused
conversions for specific errors; legitimate root upcasts must have sound native
representations. Cover absent, integer, own-string and inherited message storage,
with specific and root channels, local/imported identities and project modes.
Preserve previously valid specific-error programs. Do not invent a message
fallback, silently narrow accepted language, or weaken fixtures. If the existing
contract cannot decide a necessary language behavior, return needs-new-scope
with the precise user choice before implementing that policy.

This is a separately bounded mechanism item under the user's instruction to
record second-review defects as later work. It does not reopen 12J/R1 for a
third review or waive the repeated, unresolved conversion obligation. M1 has
one initial exact-SHA review and at most one remediation review, limited to
this contract/mechanism and its interactions, and one final-candidate merge
gate if approval and prerequisite qualification permit. Preserve every prior
failed review/gate and do not present a changed scope as approval of old code.

Named validation: `cargo test -p sifr_driver async_python_error_channel`,
`cargo test -p sifr_codegen`, `cargo test -p sifr_driver`,
`cargo build --locked -p sifr`, demo freshness update/check with that compiler,
the original `async-declaration-examples` and `async-context-examples` Python
interop command, `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings`, `cargo fmt --check`,
HIR and file-size guards, and the single `scripts/run_all_tests.sh --profile merge`.
Register focused named regressions before testing; reuse unchanged evidence.
If a frontend/lowering/IR change is necessary to this representation contract,
register its affected original Item12J crate test command before implementation.
Implement the complete bounded correction before testing. Keep 12I native
qualification, 12B/12C, SQL coverage, TypeVar #3667, and other follow-ups outside
this worker. Preserve an approved candidate for 12K if an external dependency
prevents standalone merge; never integrate an unapproved candidate as-is.

### Item12J-M1 decision blocker (2026-09-06)

Popper is closed. Its independent checkout
`/private/tmp/sifr-item12j-m1.VO82Kk/sifr` preserves documentation-only record
`054a823b9aaafd388ddf1d944f1b7e50fcb95c29` and the complete prior lineage.
[Contract handoff](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3699#issuecomment-5556341900)
establishes that architecture requires constructor-supplied inherited
`message: str`, while accepted message-less/integer-message specific errors
have no such storage. Existing Display behavior does not specify a root
conversion policy. The worker made no language choice or compiler change;
M1 reviews and gates remain unused. Prior 12J/R1 remains unapproved.

Required user decision: enforce the documented required-string contract with
intentional constructor/override changes; explicitly authorize Display-derived
root messages; or widen the root representation to allow absent messages.
The orchestrator recommends the documented required-string contract, but has
not authorized this language behavior change on the user's behalf. Integration
depends on resolving this choice; no next implementer is live.

### Item12J-M1 user adjudication (2026-09-06)

The user answered the contract recommendation: **"Do your recommendation
through workers"**. The decision blocker above is resolved. Enforce the
documented contract that every error has a constructor-supplied string message,
including the required breaking changes to message-less constructor calls and
incompatible integer `message` overrides. This expressly supersedes M1's prior
preservation constraint for those inconsistent programs; it is not permission
to weaken other language behavior or validation.

One fresh worker owns the complete M1 implementation: consistent typed message
storage, inherited/default/custom constructor handling, declaration and call
diagnostics, nominal identity/export handling, and valid consuming root/error
conversions. Keep already-valid string-message programs and PythonError's
explicit five-field contract intact. Do not synthesize fallback text, derive
root messages from Display, or add an absent-message root representation.
Apply necessary first-party demo/fixture/documentation migrations for this
approved contract, preserving their purpose and runtime assertions. Negative
coverage must prove incompatible declarations and missing constructor arguments
are rejected before Rust emission; positive emitted/native coverage must reach
own/inherited/local/imported/project/test-project conversion paths. No partial
unused-conversion suppression qualifies as completion.

Dependencies and retained evidence are unchanged. Read Popper's contract
adjudication in independent checkout `/private/tmp/sifr-item12j-m1.VO82Kk/sifr`,
record `054a823b9aaafd388ddf1d944f1b7e50fcb95c29`, alongside the prior R1 review.
Preserve all closed worker checkouts; use a fresh owned checkout/branch and
carry this authorization into its phase record before implementation.

In addition to the M1 commands above, register `cargo test -p sifr_ir`,
`cargo test -p sifr_lowering`, `cargo test -p sifr_frontend`, and
`cargo test -p sifr_type_system` for the affected contract crates. Reuse evidence
only where complete inputs are unchanged. Register focused regressions before
testing, finish the complete bounded code change first, then test and iterate.
M1 still has one initial exact-SHA Opus review, at most one remediation review,
and one final-candidate merge gate; none was consumed by contract adjudication.
This does not reset 12J/R1's two exhausted reviews or any dependency's gate.
Known external qualification failures retain their owners; preserve a qualified
M1 candidate for 12K if they prevent standalone merge. No parent implementation,
testing, review, gate, or next-item work is authorized.

### Item12K integration dispatch (2026-09-06)

Required-string M1 worker is closed. Its implementation is Opus SATISFIED in
[PR #3700](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3700), candidate
`d726ffc11258c49f0185fd2d49697988cf90972c`, separate terminal record
`a7e13eb45006eac925417491b89a932af5df2595`, independent checkout
`/private/tmp/sifr-item12j-m1-required.vL5lSI/sifr`.
[Evidence](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3700#issuecomment-5558143641)
records 592 active driver tests, local/project/test-project/PythonError native
regressions, precise required-message negatives, and all 264 fresh companions.
Original async runtime assertions remain unreached due to 12I. Existing 12B/12C
and #3667 failures remain separate. M1 used one initial review, no remediation,
no gate and no merge. Its non-blocking F1-F4 follow-ups remain in its record;
F3's migrated E2E/stdlib executable qualification belongs to integration.

Next ready item is the already authorized **12K integration**, not another
standalone retry of a dependency's failed gate. One fresh worker combines the
preserved 12B/corpus, 12H, 12I, and corrected 12J/M1 changes on latest main,
including merged 12G. Preserve original commits and evidence, resolve overlapping
changes semantically, regenerate affected companions, and qualify the combined
candidate before merging any affected integration. The unapproved historical
12J/R1 code is included only through the reviewed correcting M1 lineage, never
treated as independently approved. No dependency review/gate budget is reset.

Inputs: 12B Sifr `a3198ab9f936986b5ca1f9ce3fa73d36ac9ab74d` (PR #3694),
corpus `8bcbe7ab7939e5c8362c10f61a80e368022cc372` (leetcode PR #48),
12H `9b52ac20094608c8a31f252db99e49ef7c963384` (PR #3697),
12I `f6e8afd964bb214a44c50271dcb2014ee8e828b4` (PR #3698),
and M1 above. Carry associated documentation-only records without discarding
historical findings. Do not mutate retained worker checkouts or shared targets.

Named tests: all five Python dependency suites and the complete Python-interop
area from the Python owner issue; the 12B 90-case native qualification and
canonical algorithmic `leetcode-full`; coverage readiness and its four named
checks from the 12B record; affected codegen/driver/lowering/frontend/IR/type-system
crate tests; M1 `required_error_message` and `async_python_error_channel` filters;
locked Sifr build, demo freshness update/check, strict workspace Clippy, fmt,
HIR and file-size guards. Register exact commands and worker-owned output paths
in the item before testing, especially the retained native qualification script
whose input/output paths must not target the old worker. The single authorized
merge-profile gate supplies migrated E2E/stdlib executable coverage; verify its
actual lane coverage, and explicitly register any missing required targeted
command before running it. No filtered certification bypass or warm-cache-only
claim may replace the complete required Python area.

Complete integration code/conflict corrections before testing. Reuse evidence
only with unchanged implementation and complete validation inputs. Qualify
dependencies before spending 12K's one initial exact-SHA integration review,
at most one remediation, and one exact-final-candidate merge-profile gate.
Skip create-PR gate when merging in-session. No whole-phase review here.
If genuinely external TypeVar #3667, clean-environment Python bytecode integrity,
or another mechanism blocks qualification, record the exact owning later item
and preserve the integrated checkpoint; do not absorb external repairs, weaken
checks, repeatedly gate, or declare a partial pass. Then return blocked for
fresh sequential ownership. On successful qualification/review/gate, perform
normal-safe corpus and Sifr integration merges with exact input provenance,
reconcile the affected PRs/phase records, and stop. Remaining 12D/E/F, Item12
and docs-only12A are subsequent workers, not part of 12K.
## Item12K execution registration (2026-09-06)

Owned clone `/private/tmp/sifr-item12k.IjjbS9/sifr`, branch
`codex/item12k-integration`; evidence root `/private/tmp/sifr-item12k.IjjbS9`.
Latest fetched main is `4ce05473f58716a611ac190581bf0737ba15331e`; no new base
changes since dispatch. All submodules are independent copies at their gitlinks;
leetcode remains `8bcbe7ab7939e5c8362c10f61a80e368022cc372`.
The merges retain approved12B/H/I/M1 and their terminal record commits as ancestors.
The sole compiler conflict combines12B's registry export with M1's module-binding
export in `project_stdlib_nominals.rs`; both ownership boundaries are retained.
Generated companions will be refreshed by the combined compiler.

Historical12B compiler source was verified in its retained record as
`8c5bfefb32ccefbd8d925c14c554d3be1eb361d2`. The malformed onboarding spelling
is discarded. Separate unfinished Item12 source `8ad089a9458f35fcfa228e93fe44f4d69731828b`
is preserved and explicitly excluded by12B's implementation-provenance record;
it is not an ancestor of these qualified inputs or qualification evidence.
No Item12/12D/E/F residual implementation is imported by12K.

All commands below run from the owned clone with `TMPDIR=/private/tmp/sifr-item12k.IjjbS9/tmp`,
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/private/tmp/sifr-item12k.IjjbS9/sifr/target`,
`UV_CACHE_DIR=/private/tmp/sifr-item12k.IjjbS9/uv-cache`, `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=6`,
and `RUST_TEST_THREADS=1`. Native qualification alone retains its original
four-worker/two-Cargo-job policy and owned `native-temp` directory. No prior
binary, target, Python environment, output, or warm bytecode cache is reused.
Logs use distinct descriptive names under the evidence root; JSON outputs below
are absolute. No test is skipped or allowed partial certification. Stop on a
confirmed external prerequisite blocker before consuming review/gate allowances.

The canonical readiness suite runs exactly `coverage_matrix_readiness.py`,
`coverage_matrix_readiness_self_test.py`, `profile_assignment_matrix.py`, and
`verification_taxonomy.py`; no redundant standalone invocation is planned.
The retained90-case native script was read completely and copied outside Git
with only the old absolute root mechanically replaced by the owned root. Its
source hashes, compiler hash, corpus SHA, check/run assertions, and full case
selection remain intact; set `SIFR_QUAL_COMPILER_SOURCE_SHA` to the committed
combined source candidate. Canonical leetcode-full must pass all411 cases.

Merge profile's `e2e-pass` step has an empty fixture manifest (full corpus), and
selects stdlib_parity module-merge-check/audit-fixtures/complexity-resource/module-inventory
plus sifr_stdlib default, feature-API and all-features crate tests. This supplies
M1-F3's migrated executable coverage only if those actual lane results pass.
No current coverage pass is claimed from reading profile configuration.
One initial exact-SHA integration review, at most one remediation review, and
one final exact-candidate merge gate remain; create-pr is skipped in-session.
Old12B's two failed gates, H/I's one failed gate each, original12J/R1's exhausted
NOT SATISFIED reviews, and corrected M1's one SATISFIED review/zero gates remain
unchanged. H-F1–F5, I-F1–F3, M1-F1/F2/F4 and TypeVar#3667 retain their owners.
## Item12K terminal receipt (2026-09-06): integrated, qualification blocked

Status: **blocked, not reviewed, not merged, not closed**. The complete approved
input set is combined; this stop is the explicitly separate TypeVar prerequisite,
not any dependency's unmerged status. No next-item code was written.

- Integration draft [PR #3701](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3701).
- Exact combined implementation candidate: `7e23785ab07cba6f925eed2f934c0304750f1d74`.
- Base: `4ce05473f58716a611ac190581bf0737ba15331e`, fetched unchanged from main.
- Exact corpus candidate/gitlink: `8bcbe7ab7939e5c8362c10f61a80e368022cc372`,
  [leetcode PR #48](https://github.com/sifr-lang/leetcode/pull/48), unchanged.
- Owned clone `/private/tmp/sifr-item12k.IjjbS9/sifr`, branch
  `codex/item12k-integration`; all prior worktrees/indexes/targets and the two
  intentional parent document edits were read-only.
- SHA-keyed evidence `/private/tmp/sifr-item12k.IjjbS9/evidence-7e23785ab07cba6f925eed2f934c0304750f1d74.md`;
  sibling `changed-paths.txt` lists all196 integration paths. The external receipt
  records the final documentation-only SHA after this commit exists.
- Reviewed integration Sifr SHA: **none**. No initial/remediation Opus request,
  provider retry, create-PR gate, merge-profile gate, or merge ran. All12K review
  and gate allowances remain unused; no historical allowance was reset.

### Preserved input lineage and integration corrections

Merge commits retain12B record `8e532f15895e7005fae8c658739ba3c3a6818c18`,
12H record `b6e6210a97598fb631b929b2d4daf4012b41bb16`,12I record
`19ad69969a672d7b741122ded4dd879f2bdaf9ab`, and corrected M1 record
`a7e13eb45006eac925417491b89a932af5df2595` as ancestors, together with their
approved source candidates and original histories. Unapproved12J/R1 is present
only through the approved correcting M1 lineage; its exhausted NOT SATISFIED
reviews remain unapproved historical evidence.12B's corrected historical compiler
source is `8c5bfefb32ccefbd8d925c14c554d3be1eb361d2`.

The explicit conflict in `project_stdlib_nominals.rs` retains both12B registry
and M1 module-binding exports. The initial combined build exposed two automatically
merged checked-read registrations still using M1's old collection interface;
`error_refs.rs` now inserts IndexError/KeyError into `ErrorReferences.builtins`.
This is a two-line integration correction, not a new mechanism or third review.
The failed initial build remains in `build-integrated.log`; the corrected locked
build passes in `build-corrected.log`. Cargo.lock only adds the already-pinned
insta dev dependency from M1; no versions changed. No source assertion was weakened.

All196 paths derive from the approved input merges and these integration
corrections/records. Separate unfinished Item12 source `8ad089a9458f35fcfa228e93fe44f4d69731828b`
is preserved, not absorbed or represented as merged.

### Fresh candidate evidence and precise stop

- `cargo build --locked -p sifr`: **PASS**, combined candidate7e23785.
  Compiler SHA256 `e3f3655433274f9b1183b45adc14a1f1e899acf3b29e0fb49c35876dc531cae0`,
  rechecked after qualification. Cargo.lock SHA256 remains
  `e5f4734fc985e8b3fc041b7a03795829c766b2b96c4fa351932c89b14d255320`.
- Canonical demo freshness `--update`: **PASS**, all264 already fresh and zero
  files changed. Its complete byte comparisons also supply the unchanged-input
  check evidence; a redundant second invocation without `--update` was unnecessary.
- Full `cargo test -p sifr_lowering`: **FAIL**,1117passed/2failed/1existing ignored/
  0filtered. The3 M1 required-message regressions pass inside this full run.
- `cargo fmt --check`, HIR, diff hygiene, and canonical900-line guard: **PASS**;
  size guard checked3777 files. Relevant source did not change after these runs.
- No five-suite/full Python area,90-case native,411-case corpus, coverage readiness,
  remaining crate, focused driver, strict Clippy, E2E/stdlib runtime, or merge-gate
  pass is claimed for this new compiler. They were not run after the required
  lowering prerequisite failed. Historical input evidence does not certify them.

The sole qualification blocker is existing [TypeVar #3667](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3667):
`test_typevar_invalid_bound_shape_has_primary_range` at
`control_flow_and_strings.rs:492` and
`test_pep695_typevar_constraint_shape_has_primary_range` at line518 still require
the old “simple type name(s)” wording. The producer emits “type name(s)”.
The test blob `d842c2fd162e65dff74248c8f3d393b4274f1ca9` and producer blob
`b0971e8911997383a88e2070cb711269ce4fb9cc` are identical to main. The producer's
last change is the previously recorded `066300ff185f38b425a884a2225b72990a194e58`.
The full failure log is `lowering-integrated.log`, SHA256
`e88f93f5658254b979864e29961835a4d62e93a95d1bcaa34974f974feafb8a6`.
This is registered as **12K-B1, owner#3667**, not repaired here. The exact
[owner notification](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3667#issuecomment-5558278734)
publishes the candidate, both failure identities, unchanged blobs, and log digest.

Initial free disk was190GiB with no private target; terminal free disk183GiB and
private target6.6GiB. No cleanup or shared-target use occurred. This cold build
is correctness evidence only, not a host-sensitive performance pass.

### Handoff and remaining authority

PRs#3694/#3697/#3698/#3700 and leetcode#48 remain preserved, unmerged dependencies;
historical#3699 remains unapproved.12G remains merged through#3695/#3696.
No dependency PR was closed or falsely marked merged. H-F1–F5, I-F1–F3,
M1-F1/F2/F4 and all old failures retain their original owners. M1-F3's migrated
runtime qualification remains pending in the authorized integration gate.

Exact next action: a fresh bounded owner resolves#3667, then integration resumes
from this preserved lineage, assesses changed inputs, completes the registered
prerequisites, and only then uses the one initial exact-SHA review, at most one
remediation review, and one final-candidate merge-profile gate. No whole-phase
review, Item12 residual,12D/E/F, or12A work belongs to this session. The worker
stops after publishing this documentation-only blocked receipt.

### Approved B6 receipt and original B5 continuation (2026-09-06)

Pasteur is closed after the [approved B6 handoff](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3720#issuecomment-5560707777).
Clone `/private/tmp/sifr-item12k-b6.YxonRW/sifr`, reviewed candidate
`4d076ebe08f00ba7ff6ea6ae7f910397ba7b2356`, record
`08b2302a8f5e6af910cef00d6932c1da57ac3719`, base
`9a42fe4239426cb53438b1d8f6a000f4c0a352d5`. Only phase Markdown changed.
One initial Opus SATISFIED, zero remediation/retries/gates/merges. No B6 technical
blocker remains; narrow review does not approve merging inherited implementation.

Reproduced cause: outer and nested Cargo invocations shared an explicit target
across registry/vendor source replacement, replacing the transitive rustversion
proc macro with an incompatible crate hash despite the expected filename existing.
Corrected invocation **leaves CARGO_TARGET_DIR unset**, uses the owned clone's
default outer target and the nested probes' existing separate cache under owned
TMPDIR. Do not export one common target again. No toolchain/source/lock/fixture/
workflow change or coverage exemption was needed.

Focused doctests and actual full `cargo test -p sifr_driver` pass on the exact
B6 candidate:595 unit passes,77 normally ignored, successful final doctests.
All named static checks pass. Evidence/provenance cover32088paths,16submodules,
41receipts; full-driver log hash
`40fd5424b73d15032693fe21d987af909e60820a918ef721b24834558cb16567`.
Canonical ledgers in the clone's `target/verification/areas/`:
`item12k-b6-final-evidence.json` and `item12k-b6-provenance.json`.
Historical failed invocations remain failed. Full E2E/migratedstdlib/ignored
driver build lanes remain uncertified, not implied by the full-driver pass.

Dispatch a fresh sole worker for **original12K-B5 continuation**, not a new item
or allowance reset. Start from the complete B6 record; assess latestmain and
preserve exact corpus/ancestry. Review B5 against its original exact base
`9f8dbec61c4416d5d002a1a9c90913c00a06fe9a`; retain its two original corrections
without reimplementation. Read both prior B5/B6 dispatches and receipts. Reuse
the now-passing B6 driver/static evidence after authenticating relevant unchanged
inputs; do not repeat the expensive full driver merely for a fresh worker.
Run pending registered strict workspace Clippy and any affected named checks,
then B5's still-unused narrow initial review (maxone remediation), then its sole
governed approved-SHA merge gate. Preserve target isolation throughout. No second
gate; no full-phase review. Preserve exact gate evidence for later12K reuse.
If only inherited unreviewed integration prevents safe standalone delivery,
return the approved stacked candidate/receipts, do not invent another mechanism
blocker or merge under narrow approval. A genuine new external failure follows
the existing later-owner stop rule. Original12K remains0review/0gate and belongs
to the next fresh worker; no12K/12D/E/F/Item12/12A implementation in B5.

#### Original B5 continuation ownership

This continuation owns `/private/tmp/sifr-item12k-b5-cont.KTpKoc/sifr`, branch
`codex/item12k-b5-continuation`, its index, default target, and sibling temporary
paths. Parent and predecessor checkouts, targets, indexes, and records are read-only.
The copied dispatch above is authoritative. B5 source remains `d4d7eb5cc80e6e4e623e3b5d343702e5055f8946`;
original review base remains `9f8dbec61c4416d5d002a1a9c90913c00a06fe9a`.
Pending work is authenticated evidence reuse, the named strict workspace Clippy,
affected static checks, one narrow exact-SHA initial review (at most one remediation),
and one approved-SHA merge-profile gate. `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` stays unset.
No predecessor review or gate allowance resets. An approved stacked handoff remains
the authorized terminal state if broad original 12K approval prevents delivery.

#### B5 same-mechanism Clippy completion

Strict workspace Clippy on continuation `1321c2a75e4e146a310507c0ae2a326f5c2a5540`
found `clippy::if_not_else` on B5's explicit `!=` conditional at
`crates/sifr_driver/src/build/cargo_manifest.rs:235`. The correction tests equality
first and swaps the same two branches. Generated strings, source selection, errors,
and lock behavior remain identical; the private checksum-map alias is retained.
The failed Clippy invocation remains failed. This is the same bounded lint mechanism,
not a new item, review remediation, suppression, or gate attempt.

Since a driver source input now changed, final qualification uses the already named
`cargo test -p sifr_driver`, strict workspace Clippy, fmt, HIR, file-size, and diff
checks on the final candidate. The authenticated B6 full-driver pass is retained as
prior evidence, but will not stand in for this changed-source final invocation.
No broad standalone corpus or Python matrix is repeated. B5 remains zero reviews,
zero provider requests and zero gates before final qualification.

### Original 12K final delivery registration (2026-09-06)

This is the original integration continuation, with zero integration reviews,
provider requests, retries, and gates consumed before this registration. The sole
implementer owns `/private/tmp/sifr-item12k-delivery.4J6JeK/sifr`, branch
`codex/item12k-final-delivery`, its index, and sibling temporary/evidence paths.
The parent two dirty Markdown files and all predecessor checkouts, indexes,
targets, and evidence are read-only. The complete starting record is
`e9cce681e039f918aaf64daebe0d415195bb6f96`; no stack reconstruction is needed.
Actual remote main is fetched with the explicit refspec
`+refs/heads/main:refs/remotes/origin/main` and remains
`f11e1cd7eef16a02063555bccc9fd8e19287833b`. Its retained manifest is at
`internal_docs/stdlib_retained_compiler_intrinsics.toml`. All 16 submodules
must match their exact gitlinks, including corpus
`8bcbe7ab7939e5c8362c10f61a80e368022cc372` (leetcode PR #48).

The preceding original 12K named-command registration remains authoritative.
For this continuation all commands use the owned repository as cwd,
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR` unset, `TMPDIR=/private/tmp/sifr-item12k-delivery.4J6JeK/tmp`,
`UV_CACHE_DIR=/private/tmp/sifr-item12k-delivery.4J6JeK/uv-cache`,
`PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX=/private/tmp/sifr-item12k-delivery.4J6JeK/pycache`,
`CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=6`, and `RUST_TEST_THREADS=1`. Outer Cargo uses its default
repository target; nested probes retain their separate TMPDIR caches. These
settings supersede old shared-target and sibling-JSON prescriptions. Canonical
JSON receipts are under owned `target/verification/areas/item12k-delivery-*`;
raw logs and SHA-keyed review artifacts stay outside Git in the owned root.

Before review, run the newly named focused command
`python3 scripts/check_stdlib_manifest_schema.py`, plus the existing named
`python3 scripts/check_file_size_guardrails.py` and
`git diff --check origin/main HEAD`. Authenticate the complete B5 candidate tree,
all exact clean submodules, 25 B5 current artifacts, and 78 historical receipts
before reusing native 90, algorithmic 411, diagnostics 184, readiness 4, Python
30/all five suites, demos 264, codegen 1452, lowering 1119/1 ignored, frontend
139, IR 4, types 147, required-message/async filters, focused 18+8, and the final
B5 driver 595/77 normally ignored/doctests and strict Clippy passes. These are
inherited executions with authenticated relevant inputs, not fresh-SHA runs.
Only phase Markdown changes are expected; any affected input requires targeted
requalification. No unrelated test matrix or partial certification is authorized.

Read-only profile/runner inspection confirms the sole
`scripts/run_all_tests.sh --profile merge` invokes full E2E (empty fixture
manifest), migrated stdlib parity module-merge-check/audit-fixtures/
complexity-resource/module-inventory and default/feature-API/all-features
stdlib crate tests. It also invokes the normally ignored driver build lane as
`cargo test -p sifr_driver --lib -- --ignored --test-threads=1` and CLI generated
build lane. These exact commands are registered as part of that gate; no
duplicate standalone execution is planned. Their actual results remain pending.
The gate's normal setup may build the owned compiler. No cold build is
host-sensitive performance evidence, and no gate prefix constitutes a pass.

Freeze source/corpus/gitlinks before one exact-SHA full integration Opus review
against assessed main, with at most one remediation review and at most three
failed provider attempts in distinct temporary directories. Then run the one
original integration merge gate on that exact approved SHA, skipping create-pr.
No B5 gate is repeated. After complete pass, merge corpus PR #48 normally while
preserving its approved commit as Sifr's gitlink; merge the approved Sifr
integration normally without squashing away retained ancestry. Reconcile
dependent PRs and owning issues through delivery records, preserving failed
12J/R1 history and separate correcting M1 approval. Record review and gate
evidence outside the approved tree, update phase records after merge, and stop.
No 12D/E/F, retained Item12 source 8ad089a, or 12A work is included.

### Approved B5 receipt and original12K final qualification dispatch (2026-09-06)

Kant is closed after the [B5 terminal receipt](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3719#issuecomment-5560928823).
Start from its clean preserved clone `/private/tmp/sifr-item12k-b5-cont.KTpKoc/sifr`,
reviewed/gated candidate `e5ff95f5c4f4708542e6367671e751c7bcf82e98`, record
`e9cce681e039f918aaf64daebe0d415195bb6f96`. B5's exact review base remains
`9f8dbec61c4416d5d002a1a9c90913c00a06fe9a`; main/corpus remain f11e1cd/8bcbe7a.
Final B5 equality-first conditional and exact private type alias are approved;
no manifest/lock-source semantics changed. Narrow review SATISFIED, no blockers.
Counts:1 initial review,0remediation,1provider request,0retries,1failed merge gate,
0create-pr gates,0merges. Do not repeat B5's gate or reopen its review.

Actual final-source strict Clippy, full driver595/77normallyignored plus successful
doctests, fmt/HIR/file-size/diff pass. Complete32088path/16submodule/78historical
receipt authentication is retained. Driver rerun was required by B5's equality/
branch swap; no new production change is now presumed necessary. Gate passed
Cargo setup and eight guardrails, then failed because the new clone lacked a
local `origin/main` ref. Its405.44s failed prefix is not a pass. The setup omission
is [12K-B5-V1/#3721](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3721), owned by12K
validation setup, not a newly established compiler mechanism requiring B7 code.

Dispatch a fresh sole worker for **original12K continuation** with its existing
zero initial/remediation/provider/gate counts. This uses the already authorized
original integration review and single gate, not a replacement B5 gate or new
allowance. Full-stack approval remains required even though all bounded inputs
are narrowly approved. Normal safe integration/corpus delivery is authorized
after complete valid qualification; no user reauthorization is missing.

Before expensive qualification, create an owned clone with normal retained
ancestry and exact submodules. Fetch the actual main branch into the local
`refs/remotes/origin/main` and verify it resolves to the assessed remote SHA
and supplies the retained manifest; `ls-remote` alone is insufficient. Do not
override the guard baseline to conceal missing setup. Add the focused named
`python3 scripts/check_stdlib_manifest_schema.py` check before integration review/
gate. Preserve B6 isolation: CARGO_TARGET_DIR unset, own default outertarget,
nested probes' existing separate cache under owned TMPDIR. All canonical JSON
outputs must be inside the owned repository, not a sibling evidence directory.
Read newer handoffs as superseding historical target/output-path prescriptions.

Read original12K scope, deps and named-command registrations; preserve all
12B/H/I/correctingM1/B1/B2/B3/B4/B5/B6 and corpus ancestry. Retained Item12 source
8ad089a remains separate and excluded. Authenticate full relevant inputs before
reusing expensive native90,algorithmic411,diagnostics184,readiness4,Python30/allfive,
demo264,codegen1452,lowering1119,frontend139,IR4,types147,required-message/async,
B2/B3/B4focused and nowpassing B5driver/Clippy/statics. Do not reflexively repeat
completed matrices or relabel them as fresh. Qualify only actually changed or
pending named inputs. A local build for required execution is allowed. Complete
any in-scope integration correction before final tests; register new focused
commands before execution. Historical failed/unrun commands stay distinct.

Then obtain one original exact-SHA **integration** Opus review against assessed
main, maxone remediation, and run one merge-profile gate on that final approved
SHA, skipcreate-pr for in-session merge. Full E2E, migrated stdlib and ignored
driver build lanes require actual pass; verify coverage, register any missing
required targeted command before execution. No partialcertification bypass,
third review, second integration gate or whole-phase review. Freeze corpus/
source/gitlink provenance before review and plan normal corpus/Sifr merge order
so approved inputs are not changed afterward. Source changes invalidate affected
evidence only, not unrelated work; docs-only receipt changes need no second gate.

On pass, deliver approved integration/corpus, reconcile dependent PRs and owning
issues/phase records, and stop. On true new external failure or second-review
mechanism, record later owner and stop, no unrelated repair. Already known
unmerged-stack delivery, B6 target isolation and main-ref preparation are not
new mechanism blockers. No12D/E/F/retainedItem12/12A work in this worker.

### Original 12K-B5 continuation terminal receipt (2026-09-06)

State: **source qualified and approved; gate blocked by clone setup, not merged
or closed**. [PR #3719](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3719) remains a
stacked draft. The original B5 allowance is consumed as recorded below; no new
review/gate cycle was created. This receipt supersedes B5's earlier pending
Clippy/review status without relabeling any historical failed invocation.

Exact identities:

- Original review base: `9f8dbec61c4416d5d002a1a9c90913c00a06fe9a`.
- Original B5 source: `d4d7eb5cc80e6e4e623e3b5d343702e5055f8946`.
- Retained approved B6 candidate: `4d076ebe08f00ba7ff6ea6ae7f910397ba7b2356`;
  B6 record: `08b2302a8f5e6af910cef00d6932c1da57ac3719`.
- Continuation registration: `1321c2a75e4e146a310507c0ae2a326f5c2a5540`.
- Final reviewed and gated B5 candidate: `e5ff95f5c4f4708542e6367671e751c7bcf82e98`.
- Latest remote main, still in normal ancestry: `f11e1cd7eef16a02063555bccc9fd8e19287833b`.
- Exact corpus: `8bcbe7ab7939e5c8362c10f61a80e368022cc372`; all 16 submodules clean.
- Merge SHA: none. This phase-only terminal record follows the approved candidate.
- Owned clone: `/private/tmp/sifr-item12k-b5-cont.KTpKoc/sifr`; local branch
  `codex/item12k-b5-continuation`, existing PR remote branch
  `codex/item12k-b5-portable-clippy`. Parent/predecessor checkouts, targets and
  indexes remained read-only. Retained Item 12 source `8ad089a` stays excluded.

Source scope remains exactly `crates/sifr_driver/src/build/cargo_manifest.rs`
and `crates/sifr_driver/src/build/portable_project.rs`, plus this phase record.
The pending Clippy run found `if_not_else` on the original B5 `!=` conditional;
the final candidate uses equality first with the same branches swapped. The
private exact checksum-map alias is retained. No manifest-output, lock-source,
fallback, suppression, fixture, workflow, or unrelated compiler change occurred.

Actual final-candidate named evidence:

- Strict workspace Clippy: PASS (16.79 seconds). Prior continuation Clippy on
  `1321c2a75` remains FAILED exit 101, with its own immutable receipt.
- Full `cargo test -p sifr_driver`: PASS exit 0 (814.02 seconds), 595 unit passes,
  zero failures, 77 normally ignored, completed successful zero-example doctests.
  This rerun was required by the changed driver source, not a fresh-worker reset.
  The authenticated B6 pass is retained as historical evidence; prior B5 and
  original 12K failed full-driver commands remain failed.
- Fmt, HIR, file-size (3780 files, limit 900), and exact-base diff checks: PASS.
- Frozen provenance authenticates 32088 tracked paths, 16 exact clean submodules,
  78 historical receipts, and the exact equality/branch swap against B6. Retained
  native 90, algorithmic 411, diagnostics 184, readiness 4, codegen 1452, lowering
  1119, Python 30/all five suites, demo 264 and focused 18+8 remain authenticated
  historical evidence, not fresh matrices on this candidate. None was rerun as
  a standalone matrix and no partial certification bypass was used.

[The sole initial Opus review](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3719#issuecomment-5560851724)
is **SATISFIED**, with no blocking findings. Its scope is only B5. Deferred
follow-ups: existing B6-F1 copied-dispatch typography; B5-F1 later records-owner
maintenance must distinguish inherited authenticated matrices from fresh checks.
No follow-up code, remediation review, or original 12K review was started.

The sole `scripts/run_all_tests.sh --profile merge` invocation on the exact
approved candidate **FAILED exit 1 after 405.44 seconds**. Cargo setup and eight
guardrails passed: HIR, file size, emitted-demo freshness, source dependency
direction, submodule ownership, sysroot resource certification, retained intrinsic
allowlist, and adapter reachability. `guardrail_stdlib_manifest_schema` then
failed because `origin/main` was not a local ref. The worker verified the remote
SHA with `git ls-remote` but omitted materializing the remote-tracking ref in
the fresh clone. This is a worker setup omission, not an established source
regression. The checker blob is unchanged from main:
`59fb8bf6938d8a76eaf7daa083eda1d2a4dbd3da`. The missing ref is preserved for honest
failure evidence; no override, weakened guard, second gate, or merge occurred.

Later validation owner: **12K-B5-V1 / [#3721](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/issues/3721)**.
Full E2E, migrated stdlib, normally ignored driver generated builds, and all
later area/toolchain stages remain uncertified. The passing gate prefix is not a
passing merge gate or host-sensitive performance qualification.

Canonical terminal ledger: owned repo `target/verification/areas/item12k-b5-cont-terminal.json`.
Owned gate compiler SHA256: `75d52504ff1c6546f84a7156ff97efe0ee47659ad36ab5b3c26cde65e9a959c9`.
Pre-gate target 5.6 GiB/free disk 101 GiB; terminal target 10 GiB/free disk 97 GiB.
No target cleanup occurred. `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` stayed unset throughout qualification
and the gate, preserving B6's outer/nested target isolation.

Counts: **1 initial review, 0 remediation reviews, 1 provider request, 0 retries,
0 create-pr gates, 1 failed merge-profile gate, 0 merges**. This continuation ran
two Clippy commands (one failed, one passed), one successful full driver command,
and four successful final static checks. Earlier B5's failed driver invocation
and original 12K's old failed commands remain separately retained. Original
12K's own review/provider/gate counts remain zero; predecessor allowances are not reset.

Exact next action belongs to the later integration validation owner: materialize
and verify the required main ref in its owned clone before any newly authorized
qualification, preserve these exact source/review/test receipts, and obtain
explicit authority for any replacement gate. Original 12K still requires its
separate integration review and valid delivery evidence. No B5 gate retry, next
item implementation, inherited implementation merge, or whole-phase review is
authorized or started by this receipt. This B5 worker stops here.
